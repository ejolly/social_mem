SID000120,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy Garrity is the father of Lyla Garrity who is an essential character of the show um so Buddy Garrity's character really is ((much; around 0:14)) in the context of Lyla. He's, he's bored. He seems really to actually exist just to make Coach Taylor's life harder. Um, so, he's like he's this red-face grey haired white dude who knows, or thinks he knows way better than anybody else, about football. So sort of and it seems as though he must have some kind of stake in this football team that you know forces Coach Taylor to listen to him, but i- i must have missed what that is um becuase he know he takes a lot of liberaty on the football field sort of bring the other quraterback in but coach taylor isn't really sure if he wants to bring the other quarterback in and sort of just like talking to coach taylor and telling him how to run his team and and coach taylor sort of has to feel this uh this sort of like arrogance and confidence in this guy and deal you know deal with it even though he doesnt necessarily always agree with what the guy is saying. He also has serveal monologues where he just talks about you know how nobody cares like everybody wants to see the team win you know he's one of the main fresher points i think for coach taylor as well because you know he's just like nobody like this this town needs needs a win um when you know in reality winning a football game is only slightly off for chance uh (1:48) so uh just a lot of pressure and uh seems like he's a little more (Promised?) than he needs to be uh a little bit more--"
SID000120,CoachTaylor,"Okay so Coach taylor is the head coach of the Dillion high school football team. He's generally pretty light  guy. He has like a nice low  to his voice that makes you trust him . He is it's his first year as head coach of the football team and he's honestly beautifully handling  the difficulties you know with Jason Street being paralyzed and its terrible . And having to mostly having to deal with the differing expectations  of all kinds of people I mean everyone wants...everyone wants him to win so that's a huge amount of pressure but in addition everybody has a different idea about how he should go about coaching such that he makes the team win. And this is...this is sort of additional  because...because he has to sort of manage all these different peoples opinions you know while still being true to himself and not upsetting anybody and so all of this sort of doubt  is you know him him being a ilttle bit forgetful of extraneous things in his life  such as his family, you know he he tends to put a lot of stress on his wife and be a little bit neglectful of his daughter as a result of this but he also cares a whole lot about the team and you know puts a lot of time into hyou know coaching to the best of his ability and often this is very frustrating because you know when the team doesn't win it doesn't matter as if so he's put in no effort in at all like in the eyes of the people watching the coach ..."
SID000120,JasonStreet,So Jason Street is was the QB1 for this football team he's a senior in high school he's kind of like he's like the the most popular kid like everybody loves him he's also somehow like the most popular person and also like a really good person like goes to church and you know has this girlfriend that he's in love with and honestly is so perfect in fact at the beginning of the movie that you wonder either what you're gonna find out thats wrong about him or what's going to happen to him and so he is in an accident in the first football game of his senior year where he becomes paralyzed from the waist down and you know this this is sort of like his this is what sort of what you see almost from the very beginning is how he how he feels when this this horrible trauma that has occured and so you know you see him kind of at first being this you know being really good natured about it  being optimistic and slowly as time goes on he sort of realizes whats whats going on and whats happened to him he becomes more and more sort of dark and less less pure I guess. You know and I think a lot of this is really its really nice to sort of see him transform in this way and sort of realize that like no not everything in life is planned and I think that some of that sort of like motivates him to start trying to you know improve and try to walk again
SID000120,JulieTaylor,so she is the daughter of... Coach Taylor and she is... she seems to one see herself separate from... it seems like she's in different social circles... football team... problems for her dad... very mature way to behave. She seems very mature in general. She likes to dance and it seems as though she does respect her dad a lot and what her dad does but at times she and her dad have a sort of strange relationship because there's so much time... you know she...
SID000120,LandryClarke,okay so Landry is a sort of a side character in the show he has blonde hair and blonde eyebrows which is very rare. He's the best friend of Matt Saracen who's a more central character in the show. So Landry is kind of a goofball which is nice juxataposition for Matt. He says a lot of things that don't make a whole lot of sense and I think Matt knows this but listens to him anyway sometimes which is which is kinda funny. Yeah and Landry seems to have an eye for females and yeah that is basically it. He's not a huge character in the show so you really only see him when he's hanging out with Matt Saracen and taking him off whatever task he's currently focused on. Although it does seem as though he is a you know nice support for Matt because he drives him places and I think it's nice for Matt who has you know a lot on his plate to get some sort of relief from time to time and spend some time with Landry just kind of seeing a kid  which is what he is and so yeah so he's sort of nice for Matt in that way but most of the scenes he appears in he's he's sort of a comic relief type character. Generally likeable but not a whole lot about him like his inner life .
SID000120,LylaGarrity,Lyla Garrity  ...and she is the type of person who seems to have plans in her life ... she wants to marry Jason and knows where to go to college  and she goes to church... and after Jason's injury it took her for a loop to the point where he's almost in denia at first that this even happened. She talks to Jason about how he's going to get better even though he's looking more and more like he'll never walk again because she is unable to give up the control that she has  over her own life like planning out every last  ...is going to happen to her and so she and Jason... he tries to drill into her head that he will not walk again and this throws her for a loop and she goes and cheats on him with Tim and there's sort of this sort of difficulty for her in giving up the life she's planned for herself and when she is sort of able to give that up in her mind  opposite direction and doesn't know what to do with herself so at this point kind of a limbo.
SID000120,MattSaracen,"Matt Saracen was a  Jason Street and he was a quarterback for the football team but because of Jason's injury he has been promoted to QB1 and so thats a sort of huge amount of pressure on him because he's actually not very good at  as it turns out and he's also juggling... pretty large things in his personal life so for example his grandmother is struggling with dementia and he's also the man of the house because his father is in Iraq sort of juggling you know taking care of his grandma taking care of the house earning money at his job putting his school work and now being QB1. It takes a, it's taking a lot of time and pressure for him to you know he's still a sophomore in high school and so what's becoming more evident is that  there's so much time doing and thinking how and doing things for other people that he hasn't really taken a whole lot of time for what he wants and doesn't really know who he is or how to express himself because  not occupied on that they're occupied on you know being you know being there for his grandmother and being there for other people and working his job and things like that so so he comes across often...... I don't think that's actually the case..."
SID000120,SmashWilliams,So Smash is one of the members of the football team. He is a kid in high school and one of the starters...popular in high school...and he's very out-spoken and he really like... for whatever reason... and he really enjoys...Tim Riggins girlfriend and yeah generally... loud football player but...
SID000120,TamiTaylor,Tami Taylor is let's see she is the wife of Coach Taylor and is forced to ...Coach Taylor...pressure...every single time. She picks up a job...she is the keeper of the house... goes to parties... she and all of this you know love for this man... so much pressure on her.. and it's very impressive and you know sometimes... she doesn't get upset at him as she should so you kind of wonder when she or coach taylor... he sort of is putting all this on her and she is accepting it and he does realize that he's putting a lot of stress on their marriage... and you know. She is also sort of like put under the same type of pressure as Coach Taylor you know but from the females around that she has to deal with from her daughter's friends and things like that and... all of these pressures that she's dealing with and she doesn't really...
SID000120,TimRiggins,Tim Riggins is another senior starter on the high school football team. He's sort of like... you know whole broody behavior  but in reality is due to some of the problems in his family life from what you can tell from the show he has a brother  doesn't really have any parents and so it really makes you wonder what kind of home or what kind of family issues he's been dealing with. He drinks a lot which also portrays this inner crisis that he doesn't really like speaking about openly and that seems  it could lead to a lot of big problems... and sort of inability to communicate to like anyone... and so so he I think it's clear as the show progresses that he's  with guilt that he caused Jason Street's injury because you know Jason got the injury on his side of the football field I think but I don't really understand football but that seems... and you know... supposed to be... Jason Street becoming injured but he can't  to anyone you know instead deals with it by not going to visit Jason in the hospital which ends up getting more  than it should because he's his best friend and Jason misses him and so he also you know it also leads to him breaking up with his girlfriend and you know a whole bunch of other bad thing...
SID000120,TyraCollette,so Tyra is a girlfriend at first of Tim Riggins ... but she doesn't seem to be particularly wedded to that label she seems like she is very sex positive and very much enjoys  and she's very pretty and people notice this specifically Smash seems to have a thing for her and they hook up at some point in the show and she actively tries to get Jason to notice her which doesn't make Lyla very happy  and so you know her personality is kind of introduced to you on this sort of weird makes you think she's being easy  which is a label that I don't like but really what  she seems very confident in herself she's very confident in herself and her relationships with people  but it also does seem like she genuinely cares all the people that she interacts with specifically Tim when she tries to open him and hope  with Jason when she actually does go visit Jason for you know for Tim to tell Jason you know that the things that Tim is going through which Tim which Tim has never actually communicated with her but she sort of knows because she she does actually you now care about him and sees you know the nature of his personality  she is she doesn't seem like a it seems like her main friends are are Tim and Jason and you  sort of see her interactions with other girls sometimes but mostly in a sort of antagonistic way
SID000791,BuddyGarrity,"So Buddy Garrity is sort of a good old boy I have to say is actually not one of my favorite characters he seems super invested in whether the football team is winning sort of at the expense of other things he's pretty engaged and interventionist with the new coach and insisting on how things should be done and run with the team and when the 
 quarterback gets injured he's quite proactive in going out to find a new quarterback who ends up being a kid who's been displaced by Katrina and this guy does go out of his way to engage with the the kids and bring them onto the team but it seems like it's probably on the edge or maybe over the line of violating recruiting laws and yet he makes all sorts of promises to this kid and to the kids 
 family about helping them you know find a job and welcoming them into the community and things that are ya know...seem like they'd be quite nice but are very much geared toward bottom-line winning and he often seems like he's around when something's going wrong that he's around to see players walk off the field during practice or when people are playing well. On the other side he is Lyla's dad and seems
 actually quite supportive of her decision making and said she has a good head on her shoulders and she'll figure out the right thing to do with her and now paralyzed boyfriend"
SID000791,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor is one of the central characters in the series. He recently was promoted to head football coach at this local... of this local town probably in part because he was the coach... long-time coach of their star quarterback and so this is his first year in that position and he really flips back and forth between being sort of a hard-ass... hardliner and being more thoughtful and ya know
 softer so he's really struggling to win the respect of the community and players. There are lots of people in town that want to tell him how to do his job and especially when things aren't going well to be right there to critique and at the same time he's trying to build the team which does through a combination of yelling and screaming and pushing them harder and also and being engaged and supportive of some of the players so for example he really goes 
 to the hospital to visit the injured start... starting quarterback and takes the time to pick up the new quarterback at the hospital after he's injured and beat up by local kids. He also has a diverse relationship with his wife she's really in a supporting role to this new Coach position and so he appreciates that and occasionally 
 really takes a moment to stop and really thank her for what she's doing and then they're also stressed about finances and having a life in that town and so sometimes he's supportive and sometimes he's short their... to their...yeah just a diversity of things that you can get from him"
SID000791,JasonStreet,"so Jason was the star starting quarterback for this school's football team but in the first game of the season things weren't going quite as well as it seemed like they should and he took a really bad hit and ended up on the ground not able to move and they came with a structure and took him to the hospital and it turned out that his back was broken in such a way that he was
 paralyzed from the waist down and had trouble using his hands so for most of the episodes he's actually in the hospital where various people will come to visit him but you know he's not able to really move or interact very much... well he's able to interact but not to...to act I guess... so a lot of the drama is about coming to accept the
 the change in his life goals that he was thinking ya know big name College and then maybe going pro and he realizes perhaps faster than his girlfriend that that's probably not an option for him anymore but he really thinks kindly or magnanimously to continue to support the team and the new quarterback and wants to watch the games and is not overtly bitter about the... the change in his life, especially toward
 his team and teammates and he goes through some... some ups and downs in the rehab process ya know... there's a scene where he's just too tired and doesn't want to keep trying and continue...and there's also scenes where ya know he's really going above and beyond what he should do in order to be happy and get better"
SID000791,JulieTaylor,"so I'm a little bit confused about who this character is I think or thought that she was the Coach's daughter but I realize he's Coach Garrity and she's Julie Taylor so maybe... maybe it's not who I think it is but anyway if it's the coach's daughter she's a... she's a fun character. She seems to be both interested in what's going on and occasionally resentful of how it impacts her life so it seems like they might have just moved 
 2 to town recently or have been thrust in the new prominence in the town by her dad's coaching position and so sometimes she's his ally and accomplice. Sometimes she's walking out because he doesn't remember when she has a dance recital or they're throwing a big party at the house and she seems a little bit romantically interested in the new quarterback the person who is sort of the focal 
 character in the show and it's just sort of a passing... passing interest at first but towards the end of the episodes the... she was having a dance recital and the new quarterback was injured... was beat up by kids from the other school so the coach picked him up at the hospital and brought them to the dance recital and so he was there after the recital and they started talking
 and the coach had just told the new quarterback that ya know he really needed to get essentially get a girlfriend get her in the back of the car and do you have somebody you're interested in not realizing that if he was interested in anybody it was the coach's daughter until toward the end of episode. The coach looks over and realizes what might be happening between his daughter and his quarterback"
SID000791,LandryClarke,"so unfortunately I don't remember too much about this character either but he's sort of the sidekick to the new HomeTown replacement quarterback and the scene I most remember is when the two of them are sitting in the diner or something like that and one of the valley girls comes up and says something like now that you're... to his friend...the new quarterback... now that you're a first string quarterback you get a first string valley girl you know what sort of baked good or what treat do you want
 before the game and the new quarterback just seems sort of taken aback and overwhelmed and his friend Dylan is like this is awesome why aren't you going with it. This is the best route to get girls it's not going to last forever like we should make the most of this while it happens. Yeah and I think he's also in some of the general social scenes but I don't remember a lot else about him"
SID000791,LylaGarrity,"so Lyla is a cheerleader at the... for the football team where the action happens and she is dating what used to be the star quarterback for this team and in the first game of the season he was hit and badly para... or badly injured and he is now paralyzed and she is in continuing to be very engaged with him and spending a lot of time with him at the hospital. She even goes and spends
 her birthday there at the hospital with him and it's very committed to the idea that he's going to be recover and recover fully and as they continue down this path they eventually have an argument about whether... where he tells her that he's not going to recover and it's... it's a fake dream and that she needs to be realistic and that he  just needs her to go away and then she...I think she does but she 
 then comes back the next day when he gets moved to rehab and continues to be engaged and supportive of him and she's also trying to convince his best friend to come and visit him and at one point she encounters his best friend... his best friend is walking along the road on the way home from football practice and she stops and asks him and starts to talk about their... her boyfriend... his friend
 and tries to convince him to go visit but ends up kissing the friend and then feels just awful about it and the friends appears actually be interested in her and she says it's just a displacement of her feelings for her boyfriend and so they...I think that's about where we leave them... She's the daughter of the the booster guy who's so interested in seeing the team win"
SID000791,MattSaracen,"so Matt is a sophomore who has been the second string quarterback and really hasn't gotten any playing time until the first string quarterback gets hurt right at the end of the... toward the end of the first game of the season and so Matt gets called on to come into the game and plays pretty badly at first but then actually does quite well toward the end and so by, just by default he's now 
 the quarterback for a team where the whole town cares about football and he's sort of been... sort of a kid that's hiding some private struggles he lives with his grandmother who suffers from some sort of Alzheimer's or dementia and his dad's in Iraq there's no evidence that there are other family adults in his life so he's the primary caretaker for his grandmother who provides some 
 parental care or guidance but he's also quite responsible for making sure that she's taking her medication and when she wanders off and retrieving her and getting her settled and comfortable again so  he has quite a bit going on at home and then suddenly he's in a prominent football role and I think... at  first he and everybody else thought that he might be happy to be out of that role but it seems like as time goes on he's excited about it even when others...ya know...
 so he's suddenly quite invested in keeping this role rather than just letting either a new quarterback come in and take it. Also he's interested in the coach's daughter and just started finding his way into the high school scene he gets coaxed along by other kids to come and destroy the car of the opposing football team but seems to actually get enjoyment out of it"
SID000791,SmashWilliams,"so Smash seems like a pretty decent guy but he has a lot of teenage extra energy tendency to push the edge so sort of say things maybe he shouldn't or take things a little farther than they should go so maybe most memorably he was doing some televised interview he's a member of the football team and they were asking him about the coach and he expressed some lack of confidence in the
 coach and the coach is watching television and saw the broadcast and called up and got everybody out of bed for an extra hard practice but that seemed to I think win him...win the coach some respect. Williams yeah seems like a dedicated good football player and also a little bit prone to get in trouble so when their locker room was trashed by the opposing team and the coach said 
 absolutely no retalliation I think Williams was part of the contingent that went and found the car of the opposing schools quarterback and they did a lot of damage to it. Beyond that he's just a general member of the social scene and tends to...like in the diner scenes push back a bit against the coach and yeah the...
 impressed by his own abilities but also reasonably committed to football and  to the team"
SID000791,TamiTaylor,"so Mrs. Taylor must be Julie Taylor's mom I must have had the last names wrong but she's the coach's wife and as such to sort of the first lady of football in this town but it's a role that she's not all that... she's conflicted about... it seems like they might be new to town he's definitely new to this job. They're...sounds like they're struggling a bit financially and trying to make ends meet while also being this suddenly very
 public figure and she's sort of a fun character for not having the natural push and pull of wanting to be supportive and helpful and play the role and also frustrated by the things that come with his position and what to ask so for example she gets pulled into the book club where it turns out that they don't actually read books but she gets put on all sorts of committees with the local ladies with the ya know super-polished look and the...
 you sit around and talk about everybody else's family and ya know what they're doing and then they are hosting the rival week week party at her house which she didn't exactly know what that was neither did the coach so neither of them saw it coming but it seems like he might have an idea that it's going to be a bigger event than she does so ultimately asks her to host and then 
 she agrees and just gets bigger and bigger and more of a demand and there again you have the the push-and-pull of her being supportive but also being frustrated and related to that she takes a job as the guidance counselor at the school where she's quite involved with the students and talking to them and giving him feedback on maybe how he should approach students as well"
SID000791,TimRiggins,"so this is the quarterback the Star Quarterback's best friend and he was sort of apathetic football player you know he was on the team he would go to practice but he usually not counting on football to make his career and he was teaching his friend about making it big and taking care of both of them but he was on the field at the time when his friend got hurt and watched that happened and is so shaken up that he hasn't
 been able to go and visit them but continues to come to football practice and one day the coach is really just railing on him and he takes off his helmet and walks off the field and one of the assistant... ya know the coach is ready to cut him from the team right there. One of the assistant coaches points out that he was actually blaming himself for the injury of his friend and so the coach for the moment lets him walk away and then
 later because of something else that happened in the plot they are having an expected late night practice that involves really extreme running up and down the hill and in the rain in the mud they're finishing up and getting back on the bus and Riggins is the last one to come to the bus the coach takes him aside and tells him that what happened is nobody's fault and he should listen to that but also that he still
 owes him a practice and he can walk home and so he's walking home when he runs into Layla his friend's girlfriend and they end up kissing by his car on the road or kissing by her car on the road on the way home and then he develops an interest in her but still hasn't been able to go visit"
SID000791,TyraCollette,"so I don't remember quite as much about Tyra I mostly know her as the girlfriend of the star quarterback's best friend and I think she mainly plays in that role in the series so that... the scene I remember best is the scene where she breaks off her relationship with a friend because he won't go and visit his friend and then later she goes to visit the hospitalized quarterback and 
 says that they don't know each other that well and she's not there to make it all better but just felt like she should come see him and interacts a bit with his new roommate who's sort of a character...the  guy is clearly impressed by her looks and wants to know what you do to get women like that to come visit you but I don't remember a lot of details about her involvement I think she's a friend of Layla's as well and part of 
 the general social scene"
SID000134,BuddyGarrity,"okay so Buddy Garrity is Lyla Garrity's father we don't know a ton about him although he is clearly heavily invested in the Panthers success. I'm not sure if he is...I dont think he's a coach or anything I'm not sure what his direct role is or I'm not sure if that's even a thing that we're aware of from the show yet but 
 we've seen him be very adamant about kind of winning at all costs sort of situation. Essentially he seems like a giant asshole so for example after the star quarterback is injured Buddy brings up this other character or this other player that is from New Orleans that was basically a refugee 
 from Katrina and is living in this... in this town but Buddy is trying to capitalize on this poor kid that was displaced because he's really good at this exact position at quarterback and just trying to bring him on to the team despite the fact that the rest of the team... I don't think really wants him there since he's just kind of shut up but
 Buddy is really pushing this because it seems like it's their chance at...at winning and he wants to win by any means necessary including replacing players that have been on the team for those that will... will get them to victory"
SID000134,CoachTaylor,"Alright Coach Taylor this coach is the coach of the Panthers and he seems to have the most important job in town so we know that he's been a coach for about 6 years with the Panthers but this is his first year as head coach and a lot of people seem to not be okay with that. A lot of the community seems to be doubting this coach and his ability  
 to effectively bring this team to succeed. We've seen a lot of you know hate kind of spread around so we've seen actually some violent acts where people have either thrown bricks through the window of his own home or have asked...have essentially cornered his daughter at a diner in one scene and asked when they plan to move out of town 
 and I think the... the negative impact of this entire town doubting the coach and doubting the presence of his basically his whole family in this town I think this is starting to wear on him a bit and it's starting to break him down. It's upsetting to watch I think he's really trying hard but it seems like everyone seems to be doubting him but my opinion
 that he is very effective. He seems to be very inspirational for these...for his team and I think he's really trying to do what's best for the team"
SID000134,JasonStreet,"Okay Jason street is the star quarterback for the Panthers. He seems to be the pride and joy of the town that they're in. Everyone seems to be kind of praising Jason as some God so of course when he gets injured during the first game of the season the whole
 town kind of just like has a massive freak out and no one really knows how to handle it. Right after he gets injured the whole stadium basically like launches into prayer and it's kind of weird and you know it's almost like this cult feeling where they're just like don't know what to do without Jason. Jason as a character I don't really like him. I think 
 you know that's maybe an unfavorable opinion everyone seems to be praising him but yeah he seems to just be this very kind of ego-driven kind of pompous asshole where you know everyone is kind of bowing down to him. After he gets injured I think he starts to face the reality of possible paralysis and starts to push away people like his girlfriend 
 Lyla and realizes that he is kind of screwed which is just unfortunate but he becomes maybe less of an asshole in those moments where he is starting to be humbled I guess...what else..."
SID000134,JulieTaylor,"okay Julie Taylor is coach Taylor's daughter she's tiny blonde girl that is very clearly she is like kind of tries to distance herself from the football players that might try to talk to her. She at one point says that she doesn't eat with football players and tries to seperate herself from
 that. However there seems to be some... some chemistry with Matt Saracen so we'll see about that. She put her... she does dance and we see that... so we see the tension that is kind of rising between her and her father the coach as the coach is facing 
 more and more pressure to do well with his team and it's putting... it's causing some distance I think between him and his daughter so I think she's trying to be as supportive as possible and you know doing things that she might need to do to help out for example and planning parties at their home for the... for the team but I think she is also 
 kind of upset about this strain on her relationship with her father as her almost misses her dance recital because of ... because of football practice"
SID000134,LandryClarke,"Alright Landry is one of the supporting characters so we don't know a lot about... we know that he is Matt Saracen's friend and probably main... probably best friend and main supporter. We... I believe first see Landry as he is the one driving Matt to football practice and kind of talking
 about whether or not Matt is going to be playing on the fields and it seems like Landry is really advocating for him and kind of being a cheerleader for him so that I think is his primary role in the show. We also know that he seems to be so he.. he at one point approaches Coach Taylor's daughter and seems to be attracted to her and
 ... tries to engage in some conversation with her and gets abruptly turned down. We know that he is an insomniac. We know that he has tried to suggest starting a Christian metal band I believe to Matt so seems a little bit of a crazy character maybe has some issues
 but we don't know a ton about his background"
SID000134,LylaGarrity,"Okay Lyla Garrity is a cheerleader she's cheerleads for the Panthers she is also to dating Jason Street and so of course she is heavily impacted and affected by Jason's injury in season 1. Lyla goes to the hospital everyday to visit him after his injury and it's clear that she is dangerously optimistic
s about his condition and keep believing that he's going to get better he's going to get better. Eventually the doctors explain that they don't believe that he's going to walk anymore and even after that she still kind of doesn't believe in things that you know the doctors don't know who Jason street is and and that you know she can expect some miracle and that everything's going to be fine and they're going to live happily ever after like they planned. She definitely seems to be living in some fantasy 
 which is really dangerous and her parents and everyone around her pick up on that and are discussing that in the show so for example her parents mention that she's not thinking about college she's not really thinking about her future she's put all of her eggs in one basket and they kind of take the blame for that thing that they've allowed her to do so. I think in episode 3 she eventually comes to realize that 
 maybe this is a problem and in frustration goes and talks to Riggins then ends up actually kissing him and I think there seems to be some tension between them now so you can see her trying to shift gears a little bit even though she still shows this optimism with Jason and they continue to interact in the show"
SID000134,MattSaracen,"All right Matt saracen is super sweet kid he is a sophomore I believe in high school he starts out in the beginning of the show as the backup quarterback of course after Jason Street has his injury. Matt ends up taking over and in the first main game when Jason has his
 accident Matt ends up basically bringing the team to Victory which is this huge you know celebratory thing and we realize maybe Matt is capable of taking this lead  quarterback role in the subsequent games. Unfortunately the team then loses the next game in part because of Matt and so as a result the town becomes very angry 
 with this poor kid and you know kind of trashes his lawn and and graffitis his little football player sign on his front lawn but it seems sort of sad or upsetting because I think this is a really sweet kid he takes care of his grandmother because his dad is away in Iraq in the military his mother clearly has some form or sorry his grandmother has some form of dementia and needs a lot of care 
 and Matt is the one to do it despite the fact that he is a high school student he's you know a quarterback on this team he's also got a job he's clearly got a lot going on and he's really trying his best to just do everything he can to keep everyone happy including Coach Taylor while doing the thing that he loves. He clearly has a crush on Tyra..or the Coach's daughter as well which complicates things a bit of course"
SID000134,SmashWilliams,"alright so we're first introduced to Smash Williams as he's being interviewed by a local some local news I believe and he is talking as if he was clearly a star player I believe he's the running back for the team and the... the reporter is asking him some questions about his family history which he very clearly and abrudtly turns
 turn down and gets agitated about those questions. He's also asked about some racism on the field which he kind of just accepts as something that isn't going to phase him I think it's what he says. As a player he seems to be very likeable in a sense that he is an advocate for the team and kind of this team bonding mentality
 suggesting that they function as a unit on the field he has a lot of issues and drama with this other character Riggins they clearly don't get along they clearly don't like each other. In my opinion it seems to be a little bit more one-sided towards Riggins not liking Smash however smash has also had some sort of interactions with
 Riggins' girlfriend which I'm sure didn't help the situation... what else..."
SID000134,TamiTaylor,"all right Tami Taylor is Coach Taylor's wife and also mother to Julie Taylor. She is probably Coach Taylor's biggest supporter and advocate and she really just tries to do everything that she can to... to make his life easier. However I think part of that is she recognizes the stress that this job is having on him and ends up taking 
 a job of her own to try to pick up the slack financially in their house so she gets a job as a guidance counselor which I think Coach Taylor isn't super happy about because that means they're working on the same building. She gets sucked into a book club with a lot of the the women in the community 
 which I think she's not super happy about it seems to be less of a book club and more of an excuse to hang out and drink wine and gossip which doesn't really seem to be her scene I don't think she's super into the town gossip especially when her husband is one of the key figures in... in that community so I think that's difficult for her she also at one point gets upset with her husband Coach Taylor as 
 he brings this like large party on her that she then of course has to plan and and cook for and again as I mentioned before since she's super supportive she kind of drops everything and make this happen but it definitely seems like she's being taken advantage of a bit and she rightfully gets upset about it and and kind of punches back and ends up getting in a fight with Coach Taylor which ultimately resolves"
SID000134,TimRiggins,"Riggins seems like a very polarizing character he is a lot more aggressive so we first meet Riggins as he wakes up from what looks like a massive hangover his brother is pushing him to get up and get ready for practice we don't ever see his parents so he seems to be mostly it seems to be 
 mostly his brother around kind of helping him out and Riggins is maybe even an alcoholic he's drinking a lot hurting a lot. Specifically he is hanging around with Jason Street a lot they seem to be best friends they're talking about life after high school and after the football career in high school so I think 
 Riggins is particularly affected by Jason Street's accident in the first episode. He has a hard time coping that refuses to go to the hospital to see his best friend I don't think he really knows how to deal with that starts drinking even more and this ends up pushing his girlfriend away Tyra and in the midst of this  
 Jason Street's girlfriend Lyla becomes upset and becomes frustrated with the fact that Riggins refuses to go see his friend they end up having a encounter which turns...well it starts out as frustration Lyla's frustrated with him and eventually they end up kissing which further separates him from Tyra"
SID000134,TyraCollette,"alright so Tyra doesn't play a role in the direct Panther community she's not a cheerleader or anything like that. She is just me a person in the community and she is dating Riggins so because of Riggins' drinking and all of this their relationship seems to be pretty complicated Tyra definitely seems like she needs a lot of attention. She's a bit of a bitch or a lot of a bitch maybe you know we've seen her calling other girls whores specifically Lyla so it seems like she may be jealous of Lyla and what she has 
 with Jason I think she's not getting that from Riggins and I think because of that she goes and seems to kind of cuddle up next to Smash a couple of times and 
 it's possible that she's doing that for attention it's possible that she's doing that to make Riggins jealous we don't really know but she definitely seems to be seeking out attention wherever she can get it and we're not totally...there's no clear reason why or what's going on in her life or what her background is like but she definitely seems to be looking for that...that kind of attention 
 and is probably jealous of of Lyla and Jason. At one point towards the end of I think episode 4 Tyra does break up with Riggins and she seems pretty upset about it you know she says they're going to break up for real if she gets into the car and then gets into the car and it's very dramatic and you know drives away and that seems to be it and she doesn't seem very happy about it"
SID000804,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy Garrity is the adult version of Smash Williams so in the same way that for Smash football is everything I think Buddy was very involved in football as a youth he was probably pretty good but I think it's dominated most of his life then and when he obviously graduated from high school he couldn't he didn't really have another passion for anything besides football  
 He runs a car dealership in the town but I think the whole point of that car dealership has something to do and away and uses the auxillary way to engage in the community and engage in the team. It's extremely important to him how well the team is doing and he'll be the first to criticize Coach Taylor or become involved even though he doesn't really have a reason to be so he's not
 on the coaching staff I don't think and but he went to go recruit Vodoo to the team because he wanted the team to do as well as possible even though he really has no incentive to be up late so it's not as great . People buy cars from him I think no matter how well the team is doing but he's still cares a lot about it and I think he cares so much about 
 the team that he doesn't really realize what else is going on with his wife or with Lyla. He wants to think of Lyla as kind of the perfect little southern belle the perfect cheerleader and have tons of surgical  Panther I think Lyla kind of fuses to justify what she does and who she is as a person even though those two might not be the same thing"
SID000804,CoachTaylor,"so Coach Taylor is definitely a family man I think above all he really cares about his team and his job and his family but I think he faces a lot of pressure to really do the best that he can and has lot of pressure from the town and the people in his life to prove himself in some way I think to me it seems like he has some mission to eventually 
 get a better job somewhere else or maybe work at a higher level within football but for the time being he really takes each player under his wing I think he's extremely strict but he does it out of a good place so he really cared about for example Matt Saracen and went to his house and went to understand his living situation and who he was as a person so that Matt could improve as a player 
 and that included introducing himself to Matt's Grandma. I think in some points he gets...he uses goals and his values so for example when they had the barbecue Coach Taylor to tell his wife and was stressed obviously about the big game coming up but I think left his wife feeling under-
 valued in that situation and was eventually apologetic but at the same time was just so concerned about what's happening in his life that he couldn't take a step back to realize what was going on within the lives of the people that he loves and cares about. yeah that is Coach Taylor"
SID000804,JasonStreet,"I would label Jason Street as a convicted dreamer he seems to have the best family background out of anyone else in the show his family seems to be extremely supportive and willing to help him reach his goals I think that was really clear before the accident in the first little bit of the first episode and after they're still trying to make his life as good as it can be once Jason had his accident and became
 paralyzed it threw everyone else for a loop but I think throughout that he's obviously angry and was dealing with it as anyone would when he is paralyzed but he kept an extremely strong head on his shoulder...his shoulders and really only had the one moment of backlash and that was that Lyla when she insisted that he was going to get better and he'd already accepted and realized that he isn't
 going to get better and realized that was not a healthy way to approach the situation moving forward I think she is going to find another way to transition kind of his again conviction and willingness to work really hard to reach a goal and something else later in the show. If he's like his roommate is involved in some sort of wheelchair sport I would guess that Jason is probably going to get involved in that and probably
 kind of use his aggression and deep set intelligence to excel in that and in the same way he'll continue to move forward and deal with what's happening in his life because of the accident I think he's going to keep moving forward and he isn't going to let even paralysis stop him from trying to be the best person he could be"
SID000804,JulieTaylor,"so I think you could put Julie Taylor in just about any different town or community and Julie Taylor would be the same person no matter where she is she's kind of... she doesn't care as much about football as the rest of the town obviously and I think even though her dad's the coach it's kind of just become a part of her life rather than something she fusses over or really cares about as a way to guide what she's going to do 
 I think that's what... she's a dancer but she's not on the cheerleading team and she has guys are interested her... in her especially Matt saracen... they're on the football team but she doesn't really care she doesn't really think that she needs to be with a football player have a certain image to kind of be cool I think she has her own set group for friends despite moving recently to the town it seems like she has a pretty good base 
 that wouldn't change if the team did super well or did super badly I think she's the most naive out of all the characters. It seems like she's had... Lyla Garrity had a different kind of sheltered life but I think she's had... Julie Taylor's had the most supportive family life and sheltered in the way that she doesn't really understand the hardships that I think like 
 Tim has gone through or someone like that and doesn't really go in their circles. I think she's younger than a lot of the other people in the show or at least comes across as younger probably because she's more naive and is kind of going to be a little sassy but is generally a really nice person"
SID000804,LandryClarke,"so I think Landry is the most likely to be successful once the show ends he's not on the football team and the only way he's really involved is that Matt Saracen his best friend is on the football team I think he's kind of the nerd of the cast and just thinks it's really cool that his friend is kind of taking on this new role and would do anything to support his friend but also kind of like any friend does kind of
 likes to pick on Matt and make fun of him but all in all his heart is genuine and he wants to see his friend do well and he wants to see the team do well he feels like he's part of the community but I think he also kind of like Matt is an outsider it would be interesting to see what he's like academically because he seems to come across as pretty intelligent and probably going to be the most likely 
 to go to college or a good college  as compared to the rest of the town who's so hung up on football that they can't really prioritize other things in their life we don't really ever get a context for Landry we don't really know what he is like growing up he's kind of always hanging out with Matt understands what's happening I think with Matt's grandma and isn't really willing to have a big discussion with Matt about that
 and it's just kind of willingly accepting and supporting his friend without ever asking for information he doesn't really need to know everything he just kind of like leads that strong presence in Matt's life that Matt needs to be the best quarterback that he could be"
SID000804,LylaGarrity,"so I think Lyla Garrity would like to think of herself has probably the southern belle of the town kind of little miss perfect but in my opinion I think she's confused out of all the characters she's so driven to be perfect and have his perfect life that she creates an image of reality that isn't actually true and so for example she tries...when her boyfriend, Jason Street was paralyzed
 she had this goal that he was going to come back and have a complete recovery and plan their perfect life and that's just not going to happen I think she's kind of the classic case of someone who has had such a sheltered life and upbringing that she can't really understand that not everything will happen according to plan and it's hard for her to adjust when something goes terribly wrong or someone reacts in a way that she hasn't already planned for
 I think this really comes across when she has her fight with Jason and then ends up hooking up with Tim Riggins which is Jason's best friend it's... she doesn't really understand what she's feeling in that moment and I think in turn, similar to Tyra wants to feel a sense of validation and security and doesn't want this
 tumultuous life that her friends are experiencing and I think in that way she tries to be there for people she tries to be really supportive but she just can't... she doesn't that capacity, she hasn't felt that capacity I think a lot of that stems from her dad who seems to be really strict and kind of vindictive in a way but he definitely would like to think that she's perfect"
SID000804,MattSaracen,"I would call Matt saracen the intimidated family man so he runs his house because his dad is in Iraq he lives with his grandma and has to take care of her and her Dementia in a way that most kids haven't really ever had to do and I think that gives him kind of this sense of responsibility and maturity that a lot of the other kids just lack
 I don't think he ever expected to be on the starting line or at least definitely didn't expect it this season when Jason is going to take it over  so I think he's thrown into that role rather than kind of being over self-confident like I think so when like smash Williams would be he is intimidated and doesn't want these people who I assume are older than him...the players who I think...the main players I think are older than him to 
 Q really be disappointed in him and so puts this kind of pressure that prevents him from being the team as effectively as he could his biggest struggle in the show is number one his family but also kind of feeling confident in his abilities and being able to move forward that guy that is used to success  he's the new quarterback 
 and with that beccomes... a lot of resp... lot of responsibilities that he has to balance with everything else that is going on in his life. I think he is kind of the cute innocent guy who has a crush on this girl and doesn't know what to do and now is kind of has to be the man of the team... yeah"
SID000804,SmashWilliams,"Smash is definitely the most head strong character in the show Smash is the first one to tell you that he's awesome and he's a star and that he's gonna do the best for his team that he can. I think he cares a lot about the team and a lot about the sport but he cares about himself and his image. He kind of remains uninvolved in the whole crowd whole paralysis issue. It seems like it happened kind of 
 outside of his life perspective and the only way it really impacts him is that it's the same team and probably Jason on his team was going to help his career be better and help him look better it seems like his family has a pretty religious background and I think his mom especially is 
 willing to scold him but I think they're just so proud of him as a football player and where he's come that they're willing to just kind of keep building up his ego until his...this fake monster where he's always talking about himself in the cafes etc. and I think he's scared that the team won't do as 
 well with Saracen and needs to have have that proven to him rather than believe it or do anything himself to make the team better. He'll make himself better but I really don't think he looks out for the rest of the team and the rest of the people. So for example when he sleeps with Tyra I don't even think he understands what Tim's going through or tries to understand that at all."
SID000804,TamiTaylor,"so Tami Taylor is I think the most caring and emotionally intelligent of all the characters she's a mother she's an advisor in the school she seems to have this outsider perspective and role where she's obviously deeply ingrained within the community being the Coach's wife and working in the school she understands kind of what the students are going through but she has this perspective that
 football isn't everything and that these kids are facing a lot more in their life then what's happening on Friday night and I think that makes her extremely intelligent and she's willing to put in the effort so for example she wants to help her husband with his career but she also has her own goals and isn't willing to completely sacrifice what she wants to do in life and how the way that she can have an impact to 
 just kind of be this secondary character in the supporting role I like she wants to make sure that football isn't dominating everyone else's existence in the town and that she kind of looks at what people are experiencing back home and gives... is able to kind of help guide them so that when football season eventually ends and they all
 graduate they have this positive tract  moving forward. I think she gets stressed because she has a lot of pressure being the wife of the town but she seems to always be able to take a deep breath and come back and approach the problems with a clear head that demonstrates that  good mother and advisor"
SID000804,TimRiggins,"so Tim Riggins I think is actually a really genuine person but has been delt a really tough hand in life and he responds to all the hardships in his life by making himself an outsider and outcasting himself and would rather just shut away his problems than deal with them so for example throughout the series he's usually drunk or if is drinking or is sitting on the couch somewhere away from everyone else 
 and he tends to isolate himself especially when something bad happens so when Jason has his accident it's clear that he thinks that he had something to do with it even though he was clearly too far away to actually save him I think he was like 30 yards away or something and...but because he feels just so personally responsible that his friends who he really cared deeply about is injured he will not go see him and will not
 really mentally figure out how to move forward  because he's stuck in this rut of guilt etc and I think it's clear that he's dealing with stuff when he ends up hooking up with Lyla and shuts Tyra out of his life Tyra was his old girlfriend who then went to Smash 
 I think because he has so much in his life he's trying to figure out he makes bad decisions because it's easier to make a quick decision on a whim than really think through what the consequences of his actions will be and that makes him an extremely complex character and I'm sure someone that will develop more throughout the series"
SID000804,TyraCollette,"Tyra is I think very driven but I think a little bit misguided she is a little immature but...but I like to think that she probably thinks she's mature it seems like she doesn't have very strong parental roles in her life if I had to guess she probably either lives alone or with a sibling and does kind of what she wants. She cares deeply about the people
 in her life so for example she was dating one of the football players Tim Riggins and she cared a lot about him seeing Jason Street about... and about how he was doing what was also endorsing his bad decisions and wanted to I think was also concerned about just like feeling validated herself which didn't lead to the most healthy relationship and then she eventually got 
 angry at him and they broke up and then in retaliation she slept with Smash I think for... in turn for some validation that she probably didn't experience when she was younger if I had to guess. Throughout the show we haven't really seen Tyra's parents at all and we don't really know what her background is we just know that she's very head strong she has a clear direction of what she wants to do and what she's going to do and she'll carry that out 
 without really caring that much about what people think of her and the perceptions of people in her life surrounding her including the adults and the administrators at the school she is definitely very well known and I think that in part because she's so outspoken so that's Tyra"
SID000435,BuddyGarrity,"yeah buddy Garrity he is I think a former football player on the Dillon team who has grown up to become a car salesman in town and I think he's probably the most prominent business man in town he's totally a snake oil salesman he seems to be a real Wheeler Dealer  kind of smoozing everyone throwing big extravagent parties but you can tell he feels like he has ownership of a...of the Dillon team in the way that he kind of contradicts
 coach Taylor all the time and gets up in his business and wants to know what his every decision is going to be. He's definitely not shy about making his opinion. So he's Lyla Garrity is Dad and I think really the most redeeming thing about his character because he's kind of oily and greasy and not very straight up as a character is that he really seems to respect his daughter's you know judgment 
 and we see that in one of the last episodes that I saw where his mother or Lyla's mother is very concerned that she's not paying attention to school that she's obsessed with you know her future with Jason that she's not being realistic and Buddy Garrity kind of blows her off which could be that he just doesn't want to...doesn't want to get involved in you know his daughter's life and his wife's issues with his daughter but I kind of got the sense that he ya know trusted her judgment and thinks she has a good head on her shoulders 
 in the last couple of episodes he's been really preoccupied with bringing this kid I think his name is Vodoo or his nickname is Vodoo from Katrina and he's... I'm sorry from New Orleans where he's been kind of displaced by Katrina and he's this incredible quarterback and he wants to bring him in onto the Dillon team to kind of bring him a bringer  and bring them to state championships and he'll do anything to make that happen"
SID000435,CoachTaylor,"okay so the picture was of Coach Taylor and the story kind of centers around him so when the first episode starts off coach Taylor is the new high school football coach at Dillon high school in Dillon Texas and he thinks he's starting off with a really strong season because the kid that he's coached since he's waited  football Jason Street is a very strong quarterback and he thinks he can lead the whole team to the States this year 
 but in the very first episode Jason is in an accident in a football game that leaves him paralyzed so Coach Taylor is kind of put in the position where he has to bring up this other kid the second starting quarterback QB 2 Matt saracen or kind of throw in the towel and say you know okay this...this team isn't going to States this year and he's got a lot of pressure on him from the community which is all about football it kind of only exists for football 
 in the meantime while he's contending or trying to bring this team to like a championship level against all the odds  and he's got the town breathing down his neck he's kind of contending with things at home where he's got a wife Tami who just accepted a position as the guidance counselor at Dillon high and his daughter Julie whose also at Dillon high I think she's a sophomore she's fifteen 
 and he kind of has... doesn't have enough time for them and that puts a lot of pressure on the family you know he doesn't...doesn't disrespect his wife but he doesn't seem to give her enough credit for how hard she works and how hard she works just being the wife of the head coach so a lot of the show is about Coach Taylor kind of carving out time to go to his daughter's recital to be home with his wife"
SID000435,JasonStreet,"yeah so Jason street is when the show starts he's the starting quarterback at Dillon High on the football squad and football team and he is this sort of all American football player he's this cute blonde boy who lives in the Heart of Texas who has you know the most beautiful girl in school Lyla Garrity is his girlfriend and the whole time you know is just in love with him. They've got his name on all these signs across town that lead up to 
 the first football game and you know you get the impression that he's a good person throughout the show and that you know despite you know all the power that he has within the team and within Dillon itself that he's kind of got the best interest of the... the town and the team in mind  and so he's... like I said he's the starting quarterback until the very first game of the season which is in episode 1 and he's making a rush towards the...
 the other team's end zone and he runs into one of the other players really hard and goes down on the field and everything goes still and then the EMTs go out and they kind of pull him off the field on a... on a board and you know he's out of the game at that point and you go on to learn that he's broken his spine and he's never going to get use of his legs again in fact for a while they weren't sure whether he was completely paralyzed or not  
 So where the show is where I left off he's just regaining use of his hands and he's been moved from the hospital to a rehab facility where he's kind of contending with his own depression and dealing with the ideas of who he's going to be if he can't be this perfect American football version of himself and what he's going to do without the use of his legs so he's just kind of dealing...(cutoff)"
SID000435,JulieTaylor,"right so that is Julie Taylor She's the daughter of Coach Taylor and his wife Tami she's 15 years old and I think she's a sophomore at Dillon High School she's not a super well-developed character yet but that could just be because it's early in the show and so what's interesting about Julie is that she seems kind of level-headed and you know I think wise for her age she doesn't especially compared with some of the other female characters her age on the show
 she doesn't seem super brash or like she's going to go do something stupid without thinking about it you know I think she's got a lot of responsibility put on her being the daughter of this kind of like I guess Civic leader you know with football being what it is in the Dillon community. That said, I think she respects her dad's job but she like her mom is definitely not completely in love with football so she seems more 
 focused on her own thing which is dancing and in fact one of the last episodes featured one of her recitals which her dad was able to make and he brought with him Matt Saracen who is the second starting quarterback on the team and is a little in love with Julie though I don't think that she's returning it quite yet I don't think she's really very enamored of him  she's...
 she's very young looking but again I think I think the thing that stands out most about her is she seems to have a good sense of her place within her family and within her school and she seems not shy about speaking her mind and like one of the things I like about her is that she seems very much like in cohoots with her mom to kind of keep her dad's head on straight and not let the football get to him... get to his head"
SID000435,LandryClarke,"yeah so that that character is named Landry Landry Clarke and he is Matt Saracen's best friend and he's not a member of the football Community in Dillon and you kind of get the sense that he's like a little bit like a stray dog he's just kind of there he keeps Matt company helps him out while he's practicing alone but he's not in anyway involved in the football that said he wants Matt to take advantage of his power as the new QB 1 to help 
 them win girls I think he's a little obsessed with the ladies and you know really not that unusual for a high schooler especially a high school boy I don't really know much about his background haven't...haven't been introduced to his family or you know what kind of student he is so he's really just kind of a supporting character I guess to help show who Matt is outside of the football community so I don't know maybe he'll get a bigger role as the show goes on. I can't really say too much about him. I guess I...I think I know more about that actor than I do about that character. He's been on a couple of other really good things like the Furgo TV Show and Black Mirror
 I guess yeah he's kind of like a comic foil to Matt who's really solemn and kind of a more serious character he helps bring a little comedy to the show and is just like kind of shows that
 there are other students at the high school other than football players and they kind of live in this second tier underneath the football players and the cheerleaders and the rally girls and yeah he's he's...you know kind of just there for now"
SID000435,LylaGarrity,"so that is Lyla Garrity and if Jason street is All American Mr. Football she is All American Miss cheerleader she is on the cheerleading squad at Dillon High and spends 90% of the show in her cheerleading uniform so you know it she starts off the show as Jason's girlfriend and I think she's a little young for her age in the sense that she is very naive she really kind of believes in this fantasy that she has 
 that she's going to marry the quarterback football player and live happily ever after and never have anything bad happen to her and so even after Jason is injured she's pretty steadfast about visiting him at the hospital everyday and even spends her own birthday with him and goes to see him at the rehab facility too but I think that her naivety is kind of like kind of also selfish 
 she doesn't really pay much attention to what he's asking her for and what he wants and in fact she kind of has him trapped because he can't move and he can't really break up with her and he can't get her to kind of back off and stop selling this story that you know everything's going to get better and that they're going to be together forever what he's kind of trying to face the tragedy that just happened to him what his life is going to be now and she's still hanging on to this fantasy she's a really sweet girl she seems very
 religious and very you know very cheerful and straightforward. Towards the end of the episode that I saw that she kind of stepped outside of that like good girl persona and hooked up with Tim Riggins who is Jason Street's best friend and I think she's going to be pretty conflicted about that and how she reconciles that with this image she has of herself"
SID000435,MattSaracen,"okay so that character is Matt saracen who I think alongside Coach Taylor is one of the main characters of the show and he starts off the first episode as QB2 he's kind of benched a lot not really a big presence on the team and not obviosuly has talented as Jason Street is and then obviously Jason has his injury Matt has to step up and be the QB and he makes this kind of incredible throw
 to win that first game but even after he makes it you know he's got people in town saying that it was a lucky pass that he closed his eyes and threw and that you know it was just kind of sheer dumb luck that he happened to get the shot that he did and so the show is really about him proving itself as a quarterback and outside of the football he's kind of like the definition of still waters run deep like you know he's not really a jock he's 
 kind of this artistic soul spends a lot of type drawing knows a lot about painters you know he's he kind of brings up Jackson Pollock at one point and we know about his home life that his dad is overseas in Afghanistan serving with the armed forces and that he's living with his grandmother but really he's taking care of his grandmother she's seems to have some sort of dementia or Alzheimer's and he's in...she's in what he describes as a good spell 
 right now where you know she's not that forgetful but we kind of see that start to come apart one day when she forgets to take her pills and ends up in a neighbor's house taking a bath so he's got a lot of pressure on him both at home and at school he's got you know a part-time job as well and football on top of all that and he's really developing a pretty serious crush for the coach's daughter Julie which is not the dumb thing on the football team to do"
SID000435,SmashWilliams,"yeah so that is Smash Williams and I think he's a running back on the team I'm not sure I ever really caught what his position was but in terms of team leadership he's definitely one of the main three when the show begins and as a character he's kind of not all that bright really hot headed really kind of emotional reacts to a lot of... a lot of like what's going on around him without thinking
 he's very egotistical and very arrogant but I get the sense that he's you know not entirely a bad character but maybe not all that smart and so all we know about him is that he's got a rivalry going with Tim Riggins' who is Jason Street's best friend and actually at one point he hooks up with Tim Riggins girlfriend Tyra 
 but I don't get the sense that he really likes her all that much I think he'd hook up with anyone and you kind of see him with his arm around a different girl in every scene so he's a bit of a player I think he really enjoys the power that he wheels on the football team  and he really enjoys starting trouble you can kind of see that when he  eggs the other kids to go smash the head quarterback of the Tigers car and also that he kind of runs his mouth a lot you get that in a couple of episodes when he's giving interviews to the...to the local newscaster you know he kind of badmouths his own coach talks about like different 
 elements of the team that are pulling their weight and I get the sense that he might be a source of conflict on the Dillon team and I'm really interested to kind of see where he goes and how his character gets developed too"
SID000435,TamiTaylor,"okay yeah so that was Tami Taylor and she is the wife of Coach Taylor the head coach of the Dillon football team and she's played by Dartmouth's own Connie Britton she's an alumni but on the show she is kind of a down-to-earth character you know she's like one of the only characters in Dilon that isn't completely in love with football it doesn't really hang her ego and her reputation and everything on the outcomes of 
 football games in town and so she's she's in I think a happy marriage with her husband and she's happy you know with her daughter Julie but you know she wants him to recognize that her work is relevant too especially when she takes a job as the guidance counselor at Dillon high and as much as she respects her husband's career I think that I get the send that she understands that the well-being of 
 all of the kids of the school is more important than the outcome of the football game so one of the last episodes that I watched yesterday she's kind of put in a position where she had to put on this barbecue for a hundred plus people because that's tradition within the Dillon football team that the Coach's wife put on this dinner before a game with their... their biggest rival the Tigers and so she's like
 left with about 2 days to put this all together and doesn't really feel that her husband is recognizing what pressure that puts on her that was unasked for but you get the sense that she's a good solid character and that she's... she's here to support her husband while at the same time she's not going to take any shit from him and she's definitely very supportive of her daughter and the two kind of seem like they're really  keeping their.. their father and husband in check"
SID000435,TimRiggins,"okay so that is Tim Riggins who is the bad boy of the Dillon high school football team you know he's is kind of good looking and brooding and not very serious most of the time he is Jason Street's best friend and when Jason gets injured he blames himself and you know spends a lot of time rewatching the play during which Jason got hurt. He's definitely a budding alcoholic who lives at home 
 with his brother doesn't seem to have a whole lot of structure in his life you know he's allowed to kind of go out screw around and drink and do whatever and no one ever really tells him not to. They just kind of let him know how disappointed they are at him you get the sense that he hasn't had a whole lot of guidance. At the start of the show he's dating a girl named Tyra who is kind of you get the sense like the school hot girl but they obviously have a rocky relationship 
 and part of that has to do with his drinking issues too and he's I think a more complex character because he obviously loves Jason and feels a great deal of responsibility for what happened to him but at the same time he can't seem to face up to going to see what Jason's life is going to look like going forward. He won't even go visit him in the hospital or the rehab center and when 
 he's walking home one night after an impromptu practice in the rain he runs into Lyla who's kind of screaming at him for not stepping up and being the best friend Jason deserves and they end up making out and from there he's kind of obsessed with Lyla and I get the sense that's kind of a deflection of the feelings that he...he's feeling for Jason right now and not facing up to the pain of knowing that his best friend is injured"
SID000435,TyraCollette,"yeah so that character is Tyra Collette who is at the start of the show she's Tim Riggins' girlfriend and she's kind of... kind of has the reputation of being the school floozy obviously dresses the part and kind of plays into it I get the sense that she's really street smart and kind of knows how to play other people and that she's not a bad person she obviously loves Tim but is kind of fed up with him even at the beginning of the show 
 and like has had enough of his drinking and actually at one point gives him an ultimatum to like come actually talk to her and go see Jason or they're through and then she follows through with it so I think that she's probably a pretty strong character and I know that she doesn't like Lyla Garrity very much they just come from very different worlds I don't know very much about her background but it seems like she doesn't have very much of 
 the structure that like Lyla has in her life and I know that you know she's... she's been involved with Smash Williams but I don't think that she really likes them all that much I think she kind of uses him just to play on Tim's emotions but  I think she really gets the rise out of him that she thinks she's going to get and she obsviously cares about Jason cuz she goes to visit him in rehab and while she'd there she
 tells him you know kind of makes excuses for Tim because you know he... he wants to come see you he just doesn't know how and that you know not to give up on that. You get the sense that deep down she might be a really decent human but she doesn't  really play that role she's kind of patty with other girls obviously doesn't mind playing with other peoples' emotions but I think she's going to develop into kind of an interesting character too"
SID000473,BuddyGarrity,"buddy Garrity is one of those characters that you know exist but you don't really care about presumably he is the father of Lyla Garrity I think he's this like scruffy white guy depicted as like a little bit sleazy and super interested in like kind of a situation with football he's kind of depicted as kind of giving the football coach a lot of crap about the decisions that the football coach is making he also doesn't really seem to be that invested his daughter's life 
 life it seems like he doesn't really seem to care when she has her like whole head in the clouds moments as a like cheerleader with her boyfriend who's now paralyzed and Buddy kind of just is kind of insignificant to be honest I don't remember a lot about Buddy and he's around and
 kinda sleazy but he's not really a character that people care that much about he seems to be kind of a secondary character that's defined by his relationship with Lyla and kind of his role in kind of like egging on the coach and kind of being annoying in that sense he seems to have really strong opinions about who he wants to be kind of the head quarterback and how the situation with Jason Street who was the head quarterback who basically got paralyzed 
 and yeah he talks in a way that is super like southern white guy he isn't in that many scenes or is one of those characters that you just have a hard time remembering cuz he's kind of generic and that's Buddy Garrity for you"
SID000473,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor is someone kind of depicted as having the weight of the world on his shoulders he has a lot of responsibilities as a head football coach and also as someone who has a family and so in terms of his family he has a wife who is this like Southern Houston Texas woman who is blonde and then he has a daughter named Julie and so he's kind of always depicted in this dilemma between like his family or his responsibilities as a 
 football coach. He's kind of seen as a workaholic and someone who like sacrifices a lot for his role as a football coach especially as his  all this pressure on him because kind of the guy that was his saving...his saving football coach or football player ended up being paralyzed and so there's a lot of weight on him now because he no longer has that guy that he just depend on to help pull the team and win the team and so he's seen as someone who screams at all of
 the team members in this like typical head coach sort of way and he works really late hours and trying to train up the people on his team but the same time he has a family and his wife is really supportive of him but yet he doesn't seem to always get kind of the the turmoil or the like emotional burden that it is on his family for example like he forgets that his daughter has a music recital or dance recital
 she's a little upset by that and then his he forgets to tell his wife that there's this huge party that has to be hosted and so she ends up having to do all this work for this party and she's like pretty upset about it but he doesn't seem to really understand why it was so much work for her set to put together a party for like a hundred people so he's kind of always seen in this confliction between wife and work and he has a lot of stress in being the football coach and trying to prove that you know he can make this team win"
SID000473,JasonStreet,"so Dylan Street oh not doing Street Jason Street is the All Star Quarterback football player of the Dillon Panthers he's kind of the coach's Golden Child and he's the reason why the team is doing so well he seems to be on track to get a college scholarship and for his life to kind of go towards professional football until during one of the games he becomes paralyzed from the waist down
 and so he could potentially regain function with his arms but not of his legs and so while in the hospital he kind of maintains an okay attitude of still wanting the team to do well he feels bad thinking that he's let down the coach he has a girlfriend named Lyla who visits him all the time and before the accident they talked all the time about how they love each other and even after the accident they talk about this but Dylan seems to not Dylan Jason seems to understand that 
 something really big has changed and in this way he's kind of accepted the fact that the accident has changed his life when he gets transferred into a rehab facility after his period of time at the hospital he starts to kind of come to terms with what it will mean in terms of like one of the guys tells him that like right now everyone is going to be supporting you and they're going to be visiting you but after awhile they're going to stop and so after he gets into the rehabilitation center at this point in 
 time is where he starts to read a term or refine his like determination and trying to work to regain strength of his arms he's kind of angsty it seems like before the accident he was like pretty cocky and thinks he's all that...that has this perfect life and dating this cheerleader super Houston Texas Christianey type of guy and then after the..."
SID000473,JulieTaylor,"so Julie is the daughter of the football coach and this is kind of her primary like relationship and how she's described she seems to be someone who is quite like she knows what she wants and this is seen through her kind of rejecting two football players who were hitting on her and she's saying that she doesn't want to date football players and she wouldn't date someone who was a football player and the rest of the show her relationship or her character is kind of seen through her... the fact that this one 
 football player really likes her and so it seemed that she dances she's also shown through the relationship she has with her parents in which she seems like a typical like girly teenager like her mom asks her to buy a bunch of food for this party and she does it but she does it in that kind of reluctant way in which a teenager would but I think like she has a good relationship with their dad 
 she asked him questions about football and things like that and she seems to care about him a lot or like there seems to be a close relationship there but it seems that she also might resent a little bit her dad's role as a football coach because it takes time away from his ability to be there for her and to be there for her family and that includes her and there's this one scene where she has a dance recital and her dad essentially forgets that this dance recital is 
 happening and she and her mom asks her like...asks the dad to be home on time and he doesn't know why he has to be and she gets upset and leaves the table and so that's kind of a running theme that even though she has a close relationship with her parents she's frustrated by the fact that her dad is not able to devote as much time as he could to the family because of his work"
SID000473,LandryClarke,"so Landry is a supporting character but he's actually quite likable and he's a best friend of Matt Sorenson who is the quarterback that kind of becomes the leading quarterback he's kind of second string but the first string guy gets paralyzed so he becomes first string and so he's always kind of depicted as kind of like a funny way it kind of like a like he's joked around as being kind of dumb and says stupid stuff but in this way he's pretty likeable so in the beginning
 of the show he tries to ask out Julie who's the head coach's daughter and gets rejected and then later on when Matt is kind of having a dilemma about like what to do now that he is like first quarterback or first string quarterback Landry kind of like makes funny comments and tries to like help him kind of like get into his role and kind of seize his moment. In this way he's seen as very loyal and dependable 
 to Matt and also likeable in the sense. When Matt gets the sign on the front of his house vandalized Landry is seen as helping him kind of wipe off the vandalized marks on the sign and he makes like a funny comment about how like maybe like Matt's Grandma's really like a witch and like that's why 
 they're not been winning the games and so Matt kind of calls him dumb and kind of laughs at him for it but he's essentially just a supporting character white guy, kind of weird, kind of jokey he doesn't have that like strong football white male look that all of the other people in the show have and so he's kind of a different character he's funny he's dependable he's loyal he's a good friend to Matt"
SID000473,LylaGarrity,"the Lyla Garrity is the head cheerleader who is like super pretty seems to have her life together she's dating the quarterback Jason Street and so when he gets paralyzed kind of or when he gets paralyzed in a football accident she is kind of super supportive of him and honestly really annoying because she just believed that he is going to get better and in this way she has some kind of like Texas white Christian thing going on
 where she like has faith that he's going to like regain use of his arms and legs even though it's basically not going to happen medically like him regaining function of his legs and so in this way she's kind f depicted as someone who is overly idealistic or kind of has her head in the clouds and doesn't really understand the situation and in this way I think she's depicted as someone who is like not that bright Lyla also has her Shining Moment when she cheats on Jason her boyfriend
 who is paralyzed with her boyfriend's best friend after a fight that she has with her boyfriend Jason and in this way she's kind of seen as someone who is perhaps not not the most morally sound in terms of sexual encounters with men because she cheats on her boyfriend once again with her boyfriend's best friend so Lyla is actually not depicted as that as this great person she's kind of seen as 
 someone whose idealistic head in cloud also a bit of a cheater her relationship is really defined by the men that she's with and her parents kind of look down on her for being so attached to her boyfriend even though like he's paralyzed and a lot of these things that she thinks are going to happen aren't going to happen in a away people kind of admire her for like her like support of Jason her boyfriend but it's done in a kind of a way that's pretty annoying especially since she cheats on him multiple times (cutoff)"
SID000473,MattSaracen,"Matt Sorenson is this sophomore football player whose kind of thrust into the spotlight after the first string quarterback gets paralyzed and injured and isn't able to play anymore and so he kind of gets put into the role of like first string even though he's really barely played and because of this he has a lot of pressure on him. He's seen as kind of like a timid guy who's not really that sure of himself but really wants to do a good job like he's a 
 a hard-working guy that people seem to like he's kind of portrayed as this like good guy football player because of his relationship with his grandma so his dad is in the Army and kind of like overseas so he takes care of his grandma and his grandma has dementia and so you kind of see the softer side of Matt Saracen as he's trying to get his grandma to take her pills trying to take care of her and you kind of see like the home in which he comes from and he's kind of is the guy who I feel like is going to get the comeback story 
 like he doesn't come from a lot he's trying to take care of his grandma but he becomes like this successful football player as I feel like we're there going with his story line he really likes Julie who is the daughter of the head football coach and it seems like he's developing a relationship with the football coach in which the football coach is kind of taking him on and kind of teaching him how to be a good football player and how to take lead and to take leadership as quarterback 
 the way he's depicted with Julie is kind of he's this nervous guy kind of not sure about how to approach her but he really likes her he kind of stumbles with his words and then this way kind of has that like good guy shy feel to him which is completely different than some of the other football players who are a lot more cocky and like know what they want and kind of think they're all that and so in this way he's kind of the main character in the show and you're kind of tracking this guy's development and how he turns out"
SID000473,SmashWilliams,"So Smash is another football player they're kind of two defining things about smash one is that he's blacks in a super super white TV show and they have to ask him about his race the beginning a says he doesn't really want to talk about it or doesn't define his experiences and the second is that he is super cocky and he's known for being super cocky there's a scene in the TV show in which he is being interviewed and he essentially says 
 something condescending about how he's so great and the coach is kind of not doing a good job and the coach ends up punishing all of the guys and making them run up and down this hill in the beginning when you first meet him it's because he's being interviewed by these television people and he is essentially saying all these things about how great he is and how he doesn't like other people on the team and then you see him in this fast food restaurant kind of 
 sitting down with all these different girls surrounding him and of course all these girls are black for some reason because it's this is a super white TV show and then he ends up confronting the other or the best friend of Jason Street in which and Jason Street is other football player so essentially gets into this fight with this other football player and ends up like punching
 this guy's face or maybe the other guy punches him I don't remember but he's seen as kind of this like aggressive guy who's always talking about how great he is and how like he needs to leave the team because and then they show him a couple times with his family and his family he kind of has like a strong-headed black mother who is willing to kind of like show him who's boss and in general he's just not a well-liked character"
SID000473,TamiTaylor,"so Tami Taylor is the wife of the football coach and because of football coach is described as having all these responsibilities and kind of having this conflict between family and work she's kind of positioned in that relationship so honestly she's way too good for that football coach she's like really nice to him and really understanding of the fact that he has to make all these sacrifices for their family for example he puts her in this situation where a couple days before 
 this party he doesn't tell her that she has to basically cook for a hundred people and she kind of like gets that all set up another example is that she decided to get a job to kind of help lighten the load for the family then she tells her husband this to which he kind of replies by saying that he doesn't want her to take the job opportunity and the reason why he doesn't want to just take it is because it's at the high school in which he works and so she would be working as a guidance counselor and honestly he has 
 no reason to be that upset about it and she was really nice about kind of how that situation went down and so she's seen as someone who kind of cares for other people because of this guidance counselor role or role...in which she listens to students about what's going on in their lives she has a daughter named Julie who she seems to have a good relationship with she seems to kind of remember everything that's going on in Julie's life like her dance recitals and things like that despite the fact that her husband doesn't really have that same memory and care for his daughter in
 that way because the conflict between family and work. She's also seen by someone who doesn't really want to do all those extra like things that moms might have to do so she is depicted as coming home from this like party with these like women and being kind of like annoyed or frustrated with like how she got signed up to do all these committees at school and so in this way she's described as someone who's kind of like really real like...like gets frustrated at her husband (cutoff)"
SID000473,TimRiggins,"Tim Riggins is the best friend of Jason Street who is the head quarterback who ends up getting paralyzed Tim Riggins is described as this super Broody like football player who is always drinking and always drunk and kind of like doesn't have his life together in that way after his best friend suffers that accident where he becomes paralyzed it shows Tim kind of rewatching these
 videos of the accident happening and in these moments you kind of develop this empathy for Tim in which you realize that you know he contains a lot of guilt about the accident you start to feel kind of bad and you start to contextualize all of his drinking as kind of him trying to not feel all the things that is going on kind of the other way that we know Tim besides being the guys best friend oh speaking of a Jason's best friend after Jason gets paralyzed Tim doesn't 
 visit him in the hospital because of the guilt that he feels about the fact that he didn't do anything how even though he was so far away like on the field he didn't even try to like help her save his friend Tim is also known for cheating on Jason with his girlfriend Lyla which is not his shining moment but in constrast to Lyla who seems to kind of still love Jason but is cheating with Tim
 Tim seems to just like genuinely really like Lyla and so he's seen as kind of making moves on Lyla and wanting to be with Lyla and having this connection with her he also kind of throws away his old girlfriend Tyra in the kind of a rude way while he's drinking he kind of just tells her to go and it seems like he doesn't really care about her but he seems to like really love Lyla for some reason"
SID000473,TyraCollette,"so Tyra is this blonde woman who is portrayed in a lot of ways by the men that she's with and so she's the girlfriend of I can't remember his name but this one guy who is really broody drinks all the time football player who is the best friend of another football player who got paralyzed and kind of starts dealing with all these different things because of the event and so in this way a lot of how Tyra comes up is when she's 
 with this best friend character that she's really has strong she seems to really know what she wants she seems to also be kind of manipulative and the fact that she cheats with that guy on with this other guy just to kind of prove a point about like how he hasn't been there lately because of the accident at one point in time she confronts her like at the time boyfriend about his drinking habits and how he is unable to kind of 
 face the fact that his best friend has become paralyzed and she's really firm about how she wants to be in the relationship and how she feels like her boyfriend needs to face the fact that his best friend is now paralyzed and he's just weak and he's not able to like face that so he's like hiding from it and then at this point in time the best friend breaks up with her 
 and she seems like really torn about it but still really headstrong and upset it so she leaves and they presumably break up another important scene with her is they show her talking to Jason Street which is the guy who got paralyzed in the hospital in which she tells him that you know she's sorry that her boyfriend or ex-boyfriend / best friend of this guy hasn't been there to visit him and you kind of see some compassion from this typically headstrong like woman"
SID000813,BuddyGarrity,00:00 I don't actually remember exactly what Buddy's role is but in terms of like his actual position but he seems to have some authority over the team and definitely over the coach what he cares most about is the success of his team and the reputation of the team in front of the town he doesn't really care all that much necessarily about the players or the coach he just wants the team to do well 00:30 and kind of live up to its expectations and legacy he is the one that got the new quarterback to come in and kind of disregard to you know the current players and team dynamics and is kind of more focused on you know having a guy in there that could fill Jason's shoes and could help them with....
SID000813,CoachTaylor,so Coach Taylor is the head coach of the team and the show starts as first year as head coach so in the last episode sort of tried to find his place...and how he approaches everything as head coach and of course in the first game Jason gets hurt and you know he has he has very much an integral part of getting that kind of fired up and ready to go and hoping to win that game and the reaction is  but then in the next game they really don't do well... for Coach Taylor because the football team is so important to the town he gets a lot of crap for how he does pretty much... the team starts to lose respect for him Smash goes on you know what he thinks about him and kind of really turns it around and makes all the teammates come out in the middle of the night to run the exercise. He kind of really feels that team bonding. It is very clear that he cares a lot about ... constantly thinking about the team and thinking how he could do better and sort of establishing his role in how he could be a good coach nd now he's trying to figure out how to bring the team together and then of course the team doesn't react extremely well to the new quarterback which originally coach taylor pushed against...
SID000813,JasonStreet,00:00 so Jason is the...is the quarterback before he got injured and he's kind of this this start in terms of he's a really good football player and he's loved by the town and he has an attractive girlfriend and the potential to go to Notre Dame so he's kind of all set and he kind of he also kind of exudes a confidence and has like a very I don't know kind of like a goody two shoes kind of vibe to him 00:32 you know very good with adults and just the confidence and just who he is as the star and in the first episode he ends of taking a hit in order to stop the other guy from making a touchdown and severs his spinal cord or injures it and is paralyzed he kind of struggles with his new identity with this idea that he's not going to walk again he becomes very moody and kind of apathetic and towards the end of the second episode you see another guy in a wheelchair that kind of pushes him and he finally kind of fights back and it seems to be the start of a turning point for him but yeah a lot of his time in the hospital is characterized by you know feeling really sad 01:32 and also very angry and we see that throughout the  and his girlfriend Lyla too... yeah also there's a lot of internal conflict probably and his shift in identity and the idea that he's not going to play football ever again
SID000813,JulieTaylor,So Julie is the Coach's daughter and really early on its established that she doesn't get involved in or doesn't want anything to do with the players on the team but she's still involved in the sense that you know is very much part of the identity of the family even though she gets kind of frustrated with her Dad for kind of focusing on it too much. Yeah still kind of a part of her life she really likes to dance and the quarterback Matt is really intereted in her but she hasn't really given him the time of day and so she kind of did talk to him at the end of her dance recital but she just kind of is a very steady character and I really like her but that Julie
SID000813,LandryClarke,So Landry is Matt's best friend and kind of in every scene that Landry is in he's kind of by Matt's side  and supports him. The first we meet Matt and Landry is when Matt's throwing the football to the tire  and Landry is sort of picking up  always seems to be kind of supporting Matt and Landry is also the one who told Matt that talk to Julie in the diner of the cafeteria. And even at the party he was by Matt's side too. Kind of like Smash he seems to kind of talk a lot maybe without always thinking. Matt's grandmother said that he needs to find some new friends or get new friends or whatever. At least at this point there hasn't been that much character development for Landry and he's very much just Matt's best friend.
SID000813,LylaGarrity,So Lyla is Jason's girlfriend and she's on the cheerleading team and kind of like Jason well more so than Jason she's fixated on this idea of this white pickett fence future she's gonna marry the quaterback and they're gonna have kids and live happily ever after and when Jason gets sick she kind of or gets hurt she doesn't except the fact that that's still not gonna be like this kind of unrealistic you know paradise world I guess? So she still kind of really  this idea and she's also a part of  also the idea of who she wants to be and how she wants to be some of that also comes out you know in her conversation with her mom and you know just kind of the... and you also get an idea of it when Tim asked if its past your bed time  its kind of this perfect good two shoes person as well but then we see when she when Jason comes and  gets angry and she kissed Tim... of course comes to him later and says no you know this... you know goes back to holding on to this idea of how she wants her life to go but then of course at the very end Tim goes in to her bedroom and kisses her and she kisses back. Definitely a developing...
SID000813,MattSaracen,so Matt is the back-up quarterback who ends up getting put in after Jason gets hurt so he's really scared and flustered things like that its his first time getting put in at such a high stakes  but he ends up really coming into the zone and he clearly cares and really values what the Coach has to say and as a character he seems to really hold a lot in and thinks a lot and really feels a big weight on his shoulders and feels responsible for taking care of his grandmother who seems to have possibly some maybe Alzheimers and feels responsible to remind her to take her medicine and meanwhile he seems to be one of the only guys who works outside of school and he works really hard at an ice cream shop and it also seems that his dad 01:02 is possibly enlisted and abroad so I'm sure that puts some weight on him  Matt really likes Julie and kind of really changes his behavior when he sees her in terms of going up and talking to her at one point he tried to show off while he was playing football he's best friends with Landry a lot of times things keep beeping  inside his head when he's having seen  he's also the guy that when they went to smash the car of the other team he kept smashing even when everyone else got in the car he was also very loyal to win the team  and said it was only him
SID000813,SmashWilliams,Smash is a pretty outgoing and outspoken person. He excudes a lot of confidence and talks with a lot of confidence which is not always well received by his teammates especially Tim. And there's been a lot of conflict with this other character Tim in terms of other girls and just sort of the way he talks about the...about the team but he does have a lot of heart and in the scene where they were running across the river he was the one that kind of got the team to come together and keep pushing and really think about why they're doing it and think about them as a team. Yeah I mean... there's a issue where he he made out with his with Tim's Tim's girlfriend but didn't seem to care very much but was very defensive of his team especially when the other new quarterback came and seemed really loyal to his current team and really liked the intrusion  and even in interviews he he's still like kind of didn't think that much before he spoke and kind of spoke badly of Coach Tanner and... yeah that's the main thing about Smash mostly his like confidence... and do without thinking is his biggest and most prominent characteristics
SID000813,TamiTaylor,So Tami is Coach Taylor's wife and she kind of like gets  very much gets roped into football and the football culture and you know attempts to embrace it by getting to know the women by making the - the different treats and  equality ...but at the same time she's juggling  more than that you know she's very smart and very..... then it seems some of the other marriages her... She also started working... but you know... shows that she does want to be a mom and more than the ...and you know... they really love eachother even though they sort of got in a little bit of an argument. They made up and they seem to have a lot of respect in their relationship and again she just seems like a really cool sort of woman and  really and definitely really embracing of her situation and sort of the coaching family.
SID000813,TimRiggins,Tim is... He you know ... you know he's been showing up to practice drunk... even then he'll show up drunk or just walks off the field and then doesn't like being told what to do kinda does what he wants so sometimes there's sort of some conflict with the coach and also... with his brother... who seems to be taking care of him but yeah he seems to have a lot of internal conflict... whatever that is....he's sort of with this girl that he seems to not really care that much about and seems to be... Jason... you know despite all these people telling him to come... seems pretty clear that you know he's interested... can't make himself do it... and then... and then kisses back and then when he meets her in her bedroom you know he clearly wants her and I guess doesn't care about Jason at that point.
SID000813,TyraCollette,So Tyra is a pretty volatile character. We first meet her when she is over at Tim's after Tim has clearly had a lot to drink. And Tim's brother is scolding him and she just like doesn't seem to really care. At that point in helping Tim  and then later you know clearly they don't have a really stable relationship and later she makes out with Smash kind of doesn't seem to really have that much of a moral compass. Later we see that that she does have a little bit that she does care and how she does talk to Tim about seeing Jason and then she actually visits Jason and seems really genuinely sorry when she's talking to him but she's she's someone who you know she's an attractive girl and kind of knows it and really uses that both to kind of her advantage sometimes but also in the way that she defends herself  and in the way she walks/talks . She kind of has a lot of attitude but its possible that its kind of a shield or a buffer cuz like I mentioned from you know with Tim and then Jason you know she does have a heart and does care.
SID000138,BuddyGarrity,"oh wow wow I just keep dozing off so Buddy Garrity he has an interesting dynamic within the whole series because i was always trying to figure out if he was the mayor or he was just the owner of this large car dealership but he has like this great influence over Coach Taylor in trying to like shape the team so he's the outside resource pouring his unwanted opinions on the team and he was able to get the Katrina 
 refugee who is super disrespectful onto the team because he's just in a sense caring about winning and moving forward the team  as if he was on the team himself and that's pretty interesting because you can see everyone's past rings who was on the team like make an appearance but going back to Buddy yeah he is also the father of Lyla and I don't think he realizes what's going on 
 in her world because he's just so focused on the team and their future success of going to states so like major role in this manipulation and influencing and you just have no idea what his real job is but thats his job in the series so"
SID000138,CoachTaylor,"So as much as Matt Saracen is trying to figure himself out within like the football realm as well as his home life and in school I'd say coach taylor has many parallels with Matt Saracen and possibly Coach Taylor can see himself in Matt Saracen in some ways more than not so Coach Taylor he's juggling like the family life a little bit of dispute with his wife and just the entire stress of being the head coach of the football team and his greatest annoyances are that he is getting so many different opinions as like the opinion is like the most like well known comodity especially in this movie. He's got so many opinions of what he should do with the team and so many doubts because its like his first year doing that... being the head coach and people say as well as he believes too that he wouldn't be head coach without Jason Street but now he's trying to work and he's coming to realize if he's able to build better relationships within the team that the team perform well and Matt Saracen will actually thrive but he's just trying to navigate his way through the dynamics of the town which is so football heavy and reliant on like a win and going to states and he just has that constant stress on him and he's just trying to figure it all out yeah... what else about Coach Taylor, yeah head football coach just trying to navigate his way through a heavily reliant football town and it's crazy because Buddy Garrity the father of Lyla constantly trying to like manipulate and control the team but there are so many moments in which you can see Coach Taylor taking reigns even though there are highly suggestive influences so it shows like a great dynamic power dynamic within...(cutoff)"
SID000138,JasonStreet,"okay Jason Street initially comes off as the main character within the first episode because he's the all around all star athlete that everyone adores and is so grateful for and that they enjoy him just being on the team in general. Coach Taylor has this unique bond with him since he like basically brought him up within the football realm since he was like quote on quote ""peewee"" peewee football but such a role is immediately taken away from him after his accident in which he suffers like a spinal injury which is going to  paralyze him from the waist down and since he's mainly in the hospital a lot and we only get to see him through the perspective of Lyla or when his like hospital mate is like interacting with him we slowly see like the bitternes that is coming out of such a go...quote unquote ""good person"" because of his injury and it just shows like how he's transformign from this all around great guy to a bitter person because of his injury hopefully he can overcome that but yeah I mean not necessarily a big fan of Jason Street but he's alright and I'm still trying to figure out how he's best friends with Rigs like I don't I don't I never saw a parallel or a overlap or anything like that I just thought they were on the same team but yeah he's a major character he was a major character its just life got taken away before him because of this paralyzation and now he's just bitter and in the hospital so that's about it for Jason Street"
SID000138,JulieTaylor,"so Julie Taylor she comes up as a minor character in a sense she is she's just the daughter of Coach Taylor and Tami Taylor but Matt Saracen has like this huge crush on her and aside from her being in this dance recital we got to see Julie and Matt Saracen truly interact after her dance recital but otherwise she brushes off as cold and indifferent towards Matt Saracen as well as the rest of the football team but it's only Matt Saracen who is trying to interact with her. And there's not much really on her emotional state or where her well-being is besides from seeing her in the dance recital setting and then her constantly getting groceries for the giant rivalry barbeque. What else about Julie...But maybe she'll bloom into something and maybe she'll have a crush on Matt Saracen I have no idea but yeah she's pretty minor not that all important but I guess you could say that's pretty she's part of this cringe this cringy scene I guess that's third order false belief like I've learned that correctly in PYSC 1 which was like cringe humor and when she is talking with Matt Saracen and then he's saying how her dance recital reminded him of Pollack, Jackson Pollack and his paintings and honestly if you were to just dissect that his paintings are just like splatter paint sort of a thing so if that how his mind is if that's representing how his mind is like about Julie's because he has a crush and all of his emotions are kind of everywhere I have no idea maybe that's too much of a dissection but yeah Julie's just a minor character and I don't know she's not she's important but trivial I guess"
SID000138,LandryClarke,yeah so Landry he is Matt Saracen's best friend and he's just focused on the goal of obtaining all the benefits that Matt saracen is getting from being on the football team as first string like he's your typical main characters' enabler or encourager or sorts he's like the he's like the (height/hype) mean  within the relationship because he's like you'll never get this opportunity to be like with so many girls like seize the day sort of a feel but yeah what else... he's just an overall hypeman for Matt Saracen but he was initially more relevant like the first episode  not so much of a third and fourth I believe but he's still like a supporting character for Matt Saracen the only thing significant I can remember about Landry well before I didn't even remember his name so I think I can say significantly about him is that he was able to influence Matt Saracen to compare himself to compare Jason Street to the red hot chillie peppers and that Matt Saracen was different and so when Matt Saracen actually had the interview he's like oh yeah Jason's great he's like the red hot chilli peppers ya know and I'm not and the interviewer would say oh then who are you and then he's like great question who am I? so that was the only influential thing that I can immediately see and coke  out of the series that Landry... I was about to say Lankar I forgot his name Landry...(cutoff)
SID000138,LylaGarrity,Typical Lyla Garrity is just your typical teenage girl who's on the cheerleading team with her boyfriend as the main quarterback just like any other high school portrayed movie or fantasized story right now her parents are super concerned that she's in a falsified reality that Jason will get better and that they'll get married some day and everything will just work out and he'll end up going to Notre Dame so her dream is like cemented with Jason in a sense that they'll just move on to better things and finish out high school through this romanticized view but that kind of changes when he yells at her and says that they're definitely not getting married and that they're basically just wasting time and that was a small realization  a realization that she was able to have with her her mother talking to her about saying like hey you should like look forward to your future and everything like yeah just because you know Jason's injured that doesn't mean like you stop living too like you've spent so much time in the hospital which I understand but I don't know she really likes the guy UNTIL she sees ahh what's his name oh right until she sees Riggs walking home you know from that bond team bonding experience and then they end up making out and I guess this is where like everything becomes complicated cuz now he likes her and like she likes him andI feel like she only like him in the sense like it's emotional unburdening and maybe she starts  feelings for Jason well that's just a whole turmoil that will stir the pot I guess later on if I were to continue watching more episodes but I don't know Lyla she's just your typical...(cutoff)
SID000138,MattSaracen,So Matt Saracen I would have to say is the most dynamic character of them all because its kind of a rags to riches story in the sense of he was always a benchwarmer and now because of the incident that happened to Jason Street Matt has the opportunity to play first string quarterback and initially he just plain sucks cuz he's never really practiced or just had the chance to be with the team members but over time like the dynamics of his characterization just truly come to full bloom because we get to see the background of his story and how he's trying to perservere in football and it's really interesting that no one necessarily has the true confidence in him confidence in him aside from Coach Taylor who can see his potential like even his father doesn't believe in him I guess but its that its football and then he's also juggling so much other things like his grandmother just got diagnosed with dementia but I honestly feel like she has Alzheimer's then his father is also in Iraq then he's he's trying to manage his crush on Julie which is the Coach's daughter and he like hangs out with his best friend Landry I think I forgot his name in the characterization thing but so yeah it was really crucial to understand like when they were wrecking the car of the other quarterback in like the rivalry team that he kept taking out his aggressions on the car and he wouldn't leave so it just shows he has so much going on and so much to balance at such a critical time in his life while trying to be the star and build the shoes and hopefully exceed the shows of Jason Street so Matt saracen has a lot going on...(seems to be cutoff)
SID000138,SmashWilliams,Oh I didn't even realize so Smash how do I describe so Smash has this arrogrant bouyancy to his personality which like he comes as as like boisterous and a bit pompous that's only because he has so much confidence within himself and his ability to play as a running back and he feels that he can lead the team to success after like Jason's fall which will hopefully be the role what Matt Saracen does but yeah it's crazy to think that Riggs and Smash were initially like not friends and Riggs just hated Smash and Smash would just like throw jabs at Riggs cuz of his alcoholism but now like cuz Jason's gone and they have to collaborate and work together to see to like foster and build this team like it's crazy on how their friendship change because how they were sitting they both in the same car to go smash the QB's car of the other team during rivalry week so they have come a long way but Smash in general he's a quite the individual who believes in..he has great leadership skills but in reality he's just a character that's tryna figure himself out too also he has a minor crush on Tyra but I don't know how that's gonna develop if it will but yeah
SID000138,TamiTaylor,Alright so Tami Taylor she is she first comes off as like a minor character she's the wife of Coach Taylor and the mother of Julie Taylor and as perceiving her as a minor character she actually has resonating impact within the series I guess per se because Tami is like the brains or like the glue that keeps the family unity together since Coach Taylor is constantly out and involved in the football team and then she is able to remind him of his like obligations within the family as well as with Julie so and also she had like that small impact on Matt Saracen and saying to Coach Taylor like oh you should talk to your players instead of just bark orders at them constantly and like have some sort of compassion and that was essential in developing like a true bonding moment between Coach Taylor and Matt Saracen cuz he was going through a rough time but yeah and also it's interesting cuz she kinda has like this 1950s role typical female role of like within the home at first but then like she develops as a character and then she also obstains a job as the guidance counselor and that still kinda unnerves Coach Taylor but its only like a slight minor thing but it was an interesting detail so she's like her own independent woman who's keeping the family unit together and juggling all these tasks and being the wife of the Coach of such a great football team so she's a dynamic character that's playing a minor role
SID000138,TimRiggins,Okay so Tim Riggins who is otherwise known as Riggs he is a troubled character whose outlet is aggression and alcohol I'm not so sure what's going on with his family dynamics but he obly lives with his brother so his parents were definitely out of the picture and he has no real reliant and emotional attachment to his current girlfriend but I feel like that all is about to change due to his crush and constant thinking of Lyla Garrity cuz that one time like they made out out of her frustration and I guess that shows some like unconscious desire for him to have a girlfriend like Lyla who cares so much because I guess Tyra and him their relationship just wasn't like that but it's unfornate that he's such a great player and he's constantly drinking and it seems like he's wasting himself away and yeah but I realized why Riggs and Jason are best friends I remember at the party that he was drinking and Jason wasn't and he was with Lyla and they were talking about their future plans about having planned in Texas sort of thing it's kind of crazy cuz now that I'm thinking about it it sounds like John Steinback sort of a dream from the Grapes of Wrath I think that was the title in which they wanted to have a bunch of land and have their own like farm situation and so I guess that's like their parallel a little bit in this film which is pretty funny now that I think about it crazy but yeah Riggins quite the character
SID000138,TyraCollette,so Tyra Tyra is interesting because she comes off as well Tyra's a very sexually active character and even though she she's dating Riggs there's no true like actual basis of their relationship in comparison to Jason and Lyla's I think Riggs just uses her for sex and I assume she had some emotional  attachment as you can see that this happens during their real breakup episode it's not like they were necessarily always together she even had intercourse with Smash and so I gotta say it was pretty funny when the mom came and caught them  and she's like yeah I'm a part of planned parenthood so you can like walk home I thought that was hilarious  but anyway yeah so Tyra I feel like she's like just emotionally troubled and she wishes she was with someone like Jason and Rigg obviously cannot provide her with any emotional support and then she just turns to Smash for such support and its crazy because Smash and Riggs used to butt heads but yeah Tyra is just possibly an insecure character who just wants to put on a faccade  of being a confident character through her like sexual actions and sexual manipulation but yeah
SID000819,BuddyGarrity,"so Buddy Garrity is Lyla Garrity's Dad and to be honest I was a little confused about what exactly his role was but like what exactly his occupation was but he kind of seems to be putting a lot of pressure on Coach Taylor and I think there's a lot of scenes showing him talking to Coach Taylor about like expectations for the team and this is like a town in Texas that's completely obsessed with football like everybody goes to the games and like
 so there's a lot of pressure on Coach Taylor and Buddy Garrity seems at least be providing like a pretty good deal of that pressure seems like he has some sort of power and he's always like kind of talking to Coach Taylor about like how they expect wins and all that another thing that I remember about him is that like Lyla overhears when it's like her birthday but she's getting ready to go to the hospital to visit Street and like have dinner with him in the 
 hospital and Lyla's mom had been like wanting to take her out for her birthday dinner and Lyla insists on going to the hospital anyway but and she overhears her parents like talking about it and I think Buddy says that he like he expects that she'll get over it soon like she'll break up with him eventually I think that's about all I remember about him"
SID000819,CoachTaylor,"so Coach Taylor is the new head coach of the Dillon Panthers the football team and he has a wife Tami and like a 16 year old daughter Julie and it seems they're new to this town and he had gotten the job originally because he had coached Jason Street in the past and he is pretty like a pretty introverted guy he seems to have like a little bit of trouble communicating his feelings but I think he's supposed to be like an admirable in like 
 respectable coach it seems like he's kind of tough on his players in some respects like when they trashed the opposing high school team quarterbacks car like he's pretty tough on them he makes them like all run stadium until they like admit who it was but nobody gives it up like basically he gives his football players like some tough love but at the end of the day it seems like he cares about them like not just as football players but also a people you know he goes to visit them in their house that he knows what's going on in their lives and he's kind of like 
 looking out for them in like helping them in their development as people but he's also under a tremendous amount of pressure due to the fact that like high school football is everything to this town they are like completely obsessed it and there's a ton of pressure on him to win games because I think it's also implied that this team was like a really good team in the past they want to make it to State and so he's under all this pressure especially after the tragic accident with Jason street like just because their star player is out doesn't mean that the town doesn't continue expect them to win and so he kind of has to whip 
 Matt saracen into shape and then and there is a whole like new thing where there's like a new quarterback coming in from Louisiana and they imply that they kind of illegally recruited him and he has to deal with all this stuff in addition to all the things with his family and he seems so Iike kind of have some struggles with that as well"
SID000819,JasonStreet,"so Jason street is the original first string quarterback for the football team I think he's portrayed pretty much as a very like pulled wholesome All-American guy kind of like a guy next door he's dating Lyla Garrity who is a cheerleader and they have all these plans to like get married in the future he wants to go to Notre Dame on a football scholarship he wants to play in the NFL like he basically has all these big dreams and he's like the All-Star he's like the one that people tend to 
 think about and talk about and he's actually the one that like kind of got Coach Taylor the job as in Coach Taylor got the head coaching job because he had previously coached Street everybody calls him street but I think Lyla sometimes calls him Jason and I guess the main plot point that like the season so far has kind of revolved around is that in the first football game of the season he takes like a pretty bad fall and he is ultimately paralyzed but I guess they don't know that immediately but basically right away they they know that its like a 
 pretty bad fall and they take him to the hospital and they operate on him and as it turns out he's paralyzed from the waist down or at least like he can only really move his hands and his arms and even that he struggles with a lot basically he's lost all use of his legs and he's never going to be able to play football or even really walk again Lyla really wants to kind of maintain some optimism that you know everything's going to be okay he's going to be able to walk like they're going to end up getting married and everything will be just as they planned 
 but it seems like Street is taking the paralysis pretty hard like he actually blows up at Lyla like he gets really mad saying that like don't you see like you're not being realistic you know I'm never going to be able to walk again and it's not really going to go like as we originally planned which kind of really upsets her so it seems like he's just having a lot of difficulty like grappling with the gravity of his injury so far like up until this point in the season"
SID000819,JulieTaylor,"so Julie Taylor is Coach Taylor and his wife Tami's daughter I think she's about I think she's either 15 or 16 years old and she also is a student at Dillon high school and she's a dancer like I mentioned previously like she has like a dance recital that like her dad's trying really hard to make it to she seems a little bit sarcastic although she doesn't really say a ton like out loud but she kind of makes these faces that look a little sarcastic 
 Matt Saracen has a crush on her I don't really think she knows it yet but like he and his friend asked to sit with her at lunch and she like refuses to sit with football team but then like at the recital she ends up talking to him and they have like a little bit of an awkward conversation but I think it like ends up getting less awkward but then the camera pans away to Coach Taylor and his wife instead like talking about them talking so I think I guess maybe she has like a hint now 
 another scene that I remember with her as when like her and her father go to this like Diner restaurant or something in this man's like talking to him about how I like if they don't get a wind soon like he's going to be out of a job and he's like kind of threatening and he actually talks to like Julie first while Coach Taylor is like getting their food or something and then he's like really unhappy about that and he tells the man like not if he has a problem to like take it up with him not his daughter 
 I think that's about all I remember about her"
SID000819,LandryClarke,"so Landry Clarke is Matt Saracen's best friend I don't really remember a ton about him because I think I thought of him like mainly in relation to Matt and like how he and Matt react to Matt's kind of stepping into the spotlight after Jason street is paralyzed in like the football game and so he's one of the few main characters that's like not on the football team or like if they're a girl like dating somebody on the football team but he's Matt's best friend I guess I assume they're probably the same age or like in the same grade and Matt's a 
 sophomore I believe so they're a little bit younger than the rest of the characters and I remember he and Matt going up to Coach Taylor's daughter Julie and asking to eat lunch with her except she told them that she doesn't eat with anybody on the football team and Landry said well I'm not on the football team but you still wouldn't eat with him because he was with Matt who was I'm trying to remember 
 what else about him yeah not much I just remember a bunch of scenes with him and Matt like driving to school together like him and Matt at Matt's house like I think I would think of him primarily just as Matt's friends"
SID000819,LylaGarrity,"so Lyla Garrity is a cheerleader she is Jason street's girlfriend and her dad is buddy who seems to be like a man who has some sort of like power or ranking in the community but I'm not really sure but I guess the main thing about her is that she's Jason's girlfriend and that she kind of has this future life with him that's all planned out and they're going to get married and all that and it seems like after he gets injured like she really tries to stay strong for him she's very devoted to him she goes to visit him like every single day 
 in the hospital but she kind of refuses to accept that things might not turn out the way that she planned it like everyday she when she goes and visits him she talks about how like a year from now this will just have been a minor blip like in a little bump in the road he'll be all better he'll be able to walk again and they're going to get married and all that and it just seems a little bit like delusional but if not it seems like she genuinely kind of believes what she saying because 
 she just cannot possibly like except that anything will turn out differently than how she originally planned it and this is actually like really starting to get on street's nerves because he knows that like it's not going to happen like he can barely use his hands as it is like he doesn't think there's ever going to be a way that he'll be able to use his legs and he like actually kind of blows off at her and he tells her you know they're not going to get married and this isn't going to be like how it works out and she leaves the hospital in tears and she's driving along the road and Tim had just been 
 like the team had been out in the rain and they had been taking the bus back but Coach was mad at him for walking out of practice and so he made him walk home and then Lyla sees Tim and then she screams at him for not going to the hospital to visit Jason but they actually end up kissing and she like tells him afterwards that she feels really bad about it and then he says that he has feelings for her and she says it's never going to happen again then it ends up happening again and I guess that whole thing is still kind of like up in the air right now"
SID000819,MattSaracen,"so Matt saracen is the new first string quarterback on the Dillon Panthers football team after Jason Street's tragic accident so he's best friends with Landry like I said before I'm he's significantly younger he's a sophomore in high school only he hadn't really ever seen any playing time before Street was tragically injured and after the injury and after they kind of carted him away to the hospital. He's like sudden Matt saracen is suddenly thrown into the game and all of a sudden like this is his first time 
 ever really playing he kind of fumbles at first and everyone thinks the game is lost but he actually ends up making like a really good recovery and the team ends up winning and all the sudden he sees himself like kinda thrust into this like major position where everybody's like looking at him and watching him and like they he's kind of having a tough time handling it seems like especially since his dad is in Iraq and they I don't think they ever really talked about his mom but he lives with his 
 Grandma who has dementia and it seems like they don't have like the best like living situation they seem to be kind of poor he's like a little embarrassed to let Coach Taylor inside his house he actually has a crush on Coach Taylor's daughter Julie like I said he like had tried to ask to sit with her at lunch and Coach Taylor like doesn't have any idea about this at first but he had been like Matt you're so tense like if there's a 
 girl that you like ask her out take her in the backseat of your car like I don't care and then one day like Matt gets in a fight well not like really a fight but he kind of smashes in the car of like an opposing team that beat them and the guys come and beat him up and Coach Taylor comes and picks him up from the hospital and they go to Julie's dance recital and all the sudden like Coach Taylor figures out that the girl that he has a crush is his daughter"
SID000819,SmashWilliams,"okay so Smash is one of the guys on the football team to be honest I don't remember a ton about him so I don't remember exactly what position he plays but I think one of the things that really stands out to me about him is that he's a little bit of a smart alec like he has a very smart mouth and also he and Tim Riggins who's another guy in the football team they really strongly dislike each other I don't think they say exactly why but they imply that maybe its like 
 because of race because Smash is African-American but Tim says no it doesn't really matter like what race he was if he was like a purple person I'd still hate him and another thing about Smash I remember is that he hooked up with Tim's girlfriend Kyra while they were still dating so she came over to his house and his mom and like I think his sister walked in on them and his mom was furious that 
 he was like hooking up with a white girl and he made her get out. I think that's most of what I remember about Smash"
SID000819,TamiTaylor,"Tami Taylor is Coach Taylor's wife she's played by Connie Britton who's actually a Dartmouth alum if the people watching this I mean listening to this are Dartmouth students so she and Coach Taylor have a daughter named Julie who is a student at Dillon high school she...when the series starts she doesn't have a job I think she's just staying at home but like a few episodes in she ends up getting a job as a guidance counselor at the school I think the main like ways in which 
 she's come into play in the show so far as like her and Coach Taylor like have some kind of conflicts regarding how he's like taking the pressure of being in such like a high pressure like spot like position like being in the spotlight with the whole town kind of watching his every move like one of these conflicts is when the new coach is like expected to host a party at his house and he doesn't tell Tami until like it's only a few days before the 
 pretty and then he tells her it's going to be like 30 people but then it ends up being like a hundred just seems like some of their problems kind of revolve around lack of communication and at the party she's like very much stressed out she's like cleaning under the table and she looks pretty angry and he tells her that like he needs her help hosting and she kind of gives him a spiel about how like she'll be happy to be like the Happy Hostess wife when she comes like up when she's ready but like just for now she needs to sulk under the table she's the 
 guidance counselor what else... oh they have like kind of I guess another kind of little fight over Julie's dance recital because Coach Taylor is really busy but his daughter has like a dance recital on an alternating week like a football game and he's not sure if he's going to end up making it but he actually ends up coming late with Matt with like a black eye but he ends up making it it seems...(cutoff)"
SID000819,TimRiggins,"Tim Riggins is another one of the guys on the football team he's Jason Streets best friend and like I mentioned before he really strongly dislikes Smash Williams he at the beginning of this season at least was dating this girl named Kyra but they seem to like have their  fair share of problems and another thing that they really emphasize about him is that he kind of has a drinking problem they show a lot of scenes of him drinking even like shows up to practice drunk a lot 
 seems like he's always kind of brooding and is like kind of hiding his feelings on the inside and like repressing stuff and especially when Street gets injured in the football game even though they were best friends he like won't go visit him in the hospital and nobody really knows why and Lyla's like furious at him for refusing to go visit his best friend and it's ultimately revealed and Coach Taylor kind of figures out  that it's because Riggins who they call him Riggins thought it was like his fault even though 
 it like really wasn't he just wishes that he could have like done something or like gone over to him or like prevented it from happening like it seems kind of irrational but it's like eating him up on the inside and it's like weeding him like not only to not go to the hospital because he feels like he can't face him after not saving him but also he's like having some problems with Kyra his girlfriend like he won't speak to her and he just keeps ignoring her and she's cheated on him a bunch of times and she ultimately, like he's skipping school and she ultimately comes to this field where he's like 
 shooting I believe she said and they break up like she says like actually I don't really remember exactly what she says but basically she was like if I walk away right now I'm never coming back he's like okay fine. Then it turns out that he actually has feelings for Lyla Garrity and she like tries to say that she like doesn't have any feelings for him but it seems like there's like a mutual attraction between them...(cutoff)"
SID000819,TyraCollette,"so Tyra at the beginning of the series at least is Tim Riggins' girlfriend and it seems like they have a little bit of like a rocky relationship in that he's very sull and he doesn't really express his feelings to her and she seems a little I guess trashy to me based on the way she kind of carries herself and the fact that she hooks up with Smash after he like starts flirting with her to make Tim mad at him and like I was said before when I was describing Smash like they get walked in on by his mom and his
 sister and his mom is like furious since he's African-American and she's white and I think his mother calls her trashy as well so she and Tim end up breaking up because like he after he kind of retreats into himself after Street's accident he like won't even speak to her so I think they haven't like spoken in a while but he knows that she hooked up with Smash and she like goes to 
 find him after he's like not in school this one day she goes I think he's like just shooting a gun in like a field with something and she wants to talk to him and he still like won't really show any emotion or kind of explain himself to her and she says you know well if you just let me walk away right now it'll be for good and she ends up walking away for good so at this point they're broken up but she goes to visit Street in the hospital and she tries to apologize for Riggins'
 absence as well saying that he like wants to but he like hasn't been able to do it yet Street like seems a little bit angry that he hasn't come I think this is before like it's before they break up yeah I think that's all I remember about her"
SID000052,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy Garrity is kind of a jerk. Um, sort of the... feeling I get from him from the show, he is I don't know his exact position, but he is like I think maybe the head of the football team or program so not the coach but maybe kinda one level higher or one
 step up that would do the management and in that sense he very much cares deeply about football, about the football team, about them doing well he's... he's very passionate about it he, he wants to see coach Taylor succeed, he wants to see the team succeed, but the sort of leads him to tell the coach always how to do his job in and not in a kind of managerial way,  
  but it in a way that kind of comes off as condescending or you know I know better than you type of way. He also doesn't seem to have the best moral compass, so he is willing to bribe or sort of underhandedly offer incentives you know, financial and other things that should not be offered to recruit a new football player, a very talented
 football player to the team and again, it's, he's he's not a jerk per se, but these these sorts of actions: the condescending nature, the the loose moral Compass, really contribute to a bad image of his character even if he really does care about the team yeah so so he's anyways"
SID000052,CoachTaylor,"So coach Taylor is the main character of the show. He's the coach of the football team as you might be able to tell from his name coach Taylor that's not his first name and he's he's a very dedicated hardworking person like a strong sense of morals or 
 a strongly held morals or beliefs so, so an example of that would be kind of at one point their school's trying to recruit This really excellent foot...er... quarterback for the football team and the other football officials or school officials at the school are kind of trying to bribe this this kid and the coach he just won't stand for that and he really, 
 even though this guy would be a big benefit to the team, he really takes amoral stance that it's wrong to bribe and you know if you want to be good at football you join my team so that kind of demonstrates this is this is a man of character. He's very much a family man, he's always watching out for his daughter trying to make sure none of the guys on the football team take advantage of her he's maybe a little 
 too watch full not quite clear how that's going to pan out as she develops a little bit of trust as the show goes on. He's a very caring husband if sometimes forgetful about his family duties cuz he's very intensely focused on football but you know he's always in the end, got his family in his heart and very dedicated to them"
SID000052,JasonStreet,"So Jason Street is or was the the star quarterback of the football team and Coach Taylor had coached him throughout his time playing football and really helped guide and shape him into the star quarterback that he he was. 
 I say was because early on in the the first episode he is injured badly and hospitalized and paralyzed. so he he can't move his legs, can't move his arms, and eventually will recover the use of his arms, but he's never gonna, according to the doctor, he's never going to recover the function of his legs. He's got an interesting character deevelopment 
 because he's very much defined as the Star Quarterback he has a very particular you know physical thing that defines him. In his own eyes, in the eyes of the community, and in the eyes of his girlfriend and this accident where he becomes paralyzed really forces him to reckon with this so he cuz he's not gonna be able to use his legs again he can't play football, at least running around football, you know he could, he could still throw a 
 football or play it in a wheelchair but maybe the past days of glory football are behind him and it's a very hard for him to let that go it's very hard for the community and especially it's very hard for his girlfriend to to let that go and to move on and accept what happened to him so it's a very much a struggle is is learning to cope with his new disability."
SID000052,JulieTaylor,"so Julie Taylor is the daughter of Coach Taylor and Tammy Taylor and she is she's a student at the high school and she seems to be studious a seemingly pretty smart we see her amidst all these football 
 players who are always, you know,  messing around and all that she's usually reading a book or or studying you know see her reading Moby Dick so you kinda get this image of her as being as I said a studious person and her father sort of has this rule that the football players don't talk to her so she knows this rule and so she she doesn't talk with the football players, well she doesn't let  
 the football player talk with her, she sort of gets up and leaves or avoids them when they try to talk with her but the new quarterback, Matt, has this crush on her and repeatedly keeps trying to talk with her and she sort of keeps saying 'you're not supposed to talk to me' and walking away but sort of as the episodes progress their conversations get longer 
 and longer and longer so you see some some development of the relationship there at least in the sense that he is eventually able to at least hold a conversation longer than 30 seconds with her. And so she does dance that's that's her one of her activities she's got a dance recital at one point in the show... yeah."
SID000052,LandryClarke,"So this character lantry I think I already forgot the name he's, he's, he's, he's, I think maybe the best way to describe him is a very good friend maybe best friend of the new quarterback on the team, Matt, he's the guy that takes over when the star quarterback is injured. Um and his kind of role on the show is
 sort of have to fit him into something is maybe kind of like the the close friend or something who is maybe trying to break their friend out of their shell or you know yeah open them up a bit more so Matt's to give some perspective here, he's uh, 
 shy is not the right word, but maybe a little more reserved and kinds and quiet and you know respectful to Authority and very shy about talking to girls and and this other character lantry again I kind of forget the name already, but the friend here he's he's a little more forward you know when they're kind of together and walking around and he's the guy that's gonna wanna  
 approach the girls and talk to them and you know is there for helping you know throw around a football with with Matt so he's he very much kind of serves as a support role maybe too, not necesasrily like the best influence persay, but definitely a character who tries to support and broaden another character's..."
SID000052,LylaGarrity,"So Lyla is the girlfriend of the quarterback the Star Quarterback who is hospitalized who's paralyzed in the first episode and she's she's a very loving and dedicated girlfriend. She's I think visits him every day in the hospital, at least is seen there
 very often always by her boyfriend's side, bringing him food, eating meals with him, helping to take care of him, always being positive around him. She is always sort of trying to get his best friend Tim to go and visit him in the hospital even though the 
 friend doesn't want to so she's she's very dedicated to her boyfriend and and she she sort of sees herself as marrying her boyfriend the quarterback in the hospital one day and this, him being paralyzed is it's very hard with her it's something that 
 it's not clear if she's fully accepted that it well, not clear actually, she hasn't accepted that he is very likely not going to be able to use his legs again he's not going to be a football player anymore that his situation is really going to change and everyone around her seems to sort of accept that and she really pushes for him to recover stay better but same time hasn't quite accepted..."
SID000052,MattSaracen,"Matt Saracen is just an absolutely wonderful person. He really fits the role of the underdog the the character I think that you would really root for on the show. He is he's on the football team but he's not from my understanding a in main player on the team initially at least he's not a star of the team. But after 
 the star quarterback gets injured and paralyzed he takes over as the quarterback, you know this kind of central role in football team and he's not he's not very good at being a good quarterback he's not, he's not terrible but he's not he's not good definitely not a star, but coach Taylor really shaped and guided and made the previous quarterback helped make the previous quarterback into the star he was so 
 you really have this kind of you know hopeful, you're really rooting for Matt to to also to you know to to be shaped as well by coach Taylor into this you know really one Star Quarterback and it's, he's just a very kind, considerate person very very you know always saying thank you and being respectful to people very very kind always. He lives 
 alone with his grandmother, so his father is in Iraq and I don't remember if they say what happened to the mother if she passed away or if she was not around or what had happened to her but he lives with his grandmother and she has dementia or maybe early onset dementia so she's fine mostly but has to take some medication and so that's kind of, you know..."
SID000052,SmashWilliams,"So smash Williams is one of the football players on the football team and from what we kind of see about him he's seems like likeable nice character very dedicated to the football team very kind of into the football culture and playing football there. He has some tension with another one of the 
 football players Jim or Jimmy I think, so this other football player's girlfriend kisses or makes out anyway they, they are intimate together she and Smash and that causes some tension with the other guy on the football team and so that that other guy and the girlfriend break up 
 and it's not quite clear where the relationship is going between the this girl and Smash but it sort of is a central point of tension on the team. Apart from that he is as I mentioned very very kind of into the football culture so he participates in the the Rivalry week and  
 you know trashing the other the other team and kind of getting in the spirit there and he's seems very dedicated to the team is nice to the other team members and to the quarterback who takes over, Matt. And yeah, that's Smash."
SID000052,TamiTaylor,"So Tammy Taylor is the wife of the of coach Taylor who is sort of the if you had to pick one main character of the show Coach Taylor would be the main character of the show kind of the central person so Tammy Taylor is his wife and so she kind of helps out with some of the with
 some of the football stuff at one point in the show a kind of around the house and so she's she's initially in the show she doesn't have a job and she she wants to get a job and so she kinda talks it over with her husband and gets a job as a guidance counselor at the school where she sort of is able to talk to the 
 football players that Coach Taylor is coaching and try and help them through their problems and they got a lot of problems and she she's helps take care of their daughter Tammy she's sort of very involved and responsible at home. As I mentioned before,  
 she helps out in one of the episodes with kind of preparing and organizing and cleaning up this giant party for all the football people. She has a very close, deep relationship with her husband they seem to have very strong relationship together and very close with their daughter as well kind of a very nice close family, yeah."
SID000052,TimRiggins,"so Tim Riggins is one of the football players on the football team his name is Tim but he looks like a Jimmy to me and he's, I'd classify him kinda the person on the show who is talented but seemingly kind of throwing away that talent or you know throwing away their life with that so you you see him drinking and kind of  
 sitting around and sometimes not taking things seriously and this is compounded by the fact that his close friends who's the quarterback on the team in the first episode gets badly injured is hospitalized and Tim's sort of sort of essential struggle in the show is that he's not going to visit his best friend in the hospital. It's very hard for him this is something he's kind of blaming himself for the accident
 kind of engaging in some self-destructive behaviors he's some tension going on with his girlfriend cuz she makes out with another one of the football players on the team and what else is so he they sort of break up and   
 he's kind of a jerk to some other people on the team is not clear how much is his you know just him being a jerk in general and how much is you know him being really affected by his friend being injured just having trouble dealing with that so yeah he's he's sort of throwing away ihis talent."
SID000052,TyraCollette,"So Tyra is initially on the show she is the girlfriend of one of the football players Tim and Tim Riggins and she at one point in the show early on flirts with and eventually leads 
 to kissing and making out with and maybe more but somebody walks in on them with one of the other football players on the team Smash while she is still technically in a relationship with Tim so Tim's kind of engaging in some self-destructive behavior being a jerk to people ignoring people maybe more so than his usual self and anyway to solve both  
 she breaks up with Tim and it's not quite clear to me what her relationship is with Smash or with Tim or where any of that's going why she's doing that she's one of the characters I felt it was a little harder to sort of understand her to get a full picture of her cuz she's not on the football team and  
 well she is the girlfriend of one of the football players she doesn't have seemingly as much screen time she seems to be someone who causes a lot of tension in the show sets up a lot of drama and plots you know by being kind of the attractive woman who's flirting with a lot of the guys and then kind of causing tension that way."
SID000820,BuddyGarrity,"Okay so the premise of the show is that there's a small town in Texas or something whose only thing they like can proud of is football well Buddy Garrity is sort of like I guess a representative of a townspeople of that folk although he does care more about like more than the regular people who care so much about football and things like he feels very proud of them so a lot of these people like including him is worried about Coach Taylor because he has never been head coach before 
 and he is like in some kind of counselor or something and he's also like friends with the mayor so he can put a lot of pressure on to the press and onto the coach as well so he once, I feel like he will be a source of conflict in the later episodes because he brought in this new quarterback from like outside of town like a really tall black dude to be a quarterback against coach Taylor's will who wants to put Matt saracen as the quarterback.  
 And he does seem like a very strong like very head first person who will clash a lot with Coach Taylor who is also kind of like that and just create conflicts for the town. I guess the one thing that's interesting about this guy is that his father is the father of Lila which I didn't really like which I mean which is not very like emphasizing the show at all but she is the best I mean she's the girlfriend of the former Quarterback who 
 got injured severely and now is like bedridden in the hospital and she visits him all the time so considering that I think it's interesting that he is willing to bring in another quarterback from outside when she cares about him so much but yeah I guess, yeah that could be a reason to bring another one in so that Jason Street can go back or maybe he doesn't like Jason Street I don't know. He's an interesting character."
SID000820,CoachTaylor,"Okay Coach Taylor is probably one of the main main characters like the two main characters other than Matt Saracen of the show and he is what you think of typical football coach in like a family Sports drama would be like. He has his humanitarian side like he cares about his students, he care about his I guess players, and he also cares about his family. And he I guess makes a really good Synergy with Matt saracen who was a sophomore and no one has believed that he would be able to do it and
 that's sort of like a parallel would coach Taylor himself where he didn't have any experience being head coach before but he's I guess willing to do well like that's like expected to do well in the later and that's why maybe he's also believing in Matt Saracin because he sees the potential and he can work together with someone he can control more rather than with somone you like completely I think the interesting part about him is that is his relationship with his family. So he has one  
 wife I mean of course one wife and a daughter and obviously he loves them very much but he shows like a very patriarchal and kind of sexist side sometimes to his wife by not respecting her as an individual who is who can work and make money on her own or like respecting her job that he's like having a hard time I mean she's also having a hard time and she still very stressful job as well and he obviously expect her to support him  
 and all his endeavors like put him first over her own job and things like that but I think he even though that it that is true I guess it's like a typical of a like a male character adult in that kind of era and that is and he is the character that those American audience like the regular audience can most sympathize with and identify with like while watching the show"
SID000820,JasonStreet,"Okay if you think about it Sports shows never have it that easy it's not fun to see like a team who's really strong and is truly strong and then it just keeps spinning right that's just that's just not a fun TV show so in terms of that, I guess it was kind of expected that Jason Street who is like this perfect quarterback and Captain and has really is really good friends with the coach as well is going to get injured somehow and
 bring a team into hardship. It's really unfortunate that he is paralyzed and he might not be able to recover from his injury but I think he will eventually like in the later Seasons but anyways talking about now before he was like this perfect guy like he was really nice to everyone he was a good leader and then a good captain and not and before he would not be a very interesting character but 
 now that he's bedridden and like his relationship his girlfriend his self-esteem issues like became very interesting and how is he going to overcome these things. I think watching the interaction with him and his girlfriend like the audience will be myself included like feel very vulnerable or like nervous at the same time because everyone knows that this is unless he recovers miraculously this is going to end pretty bad really soon and just interacting like you just feel like on edge 
 because she's just trying Lyla was trying really hard to keep it cheery and not give up hope but you can tell that Jason is being more realistic and sometimes he just can't handle it and he lets out an anger on her. The relationship between them is really interesting and especially because Lyla is now kind of interested in his best friend and yeah I don't know what's going to happen"
SID000820,JulieTaylor,"Julie Taylor is one of the three main like ? young female characters in this drama in this TV show being the coach's daughter she she makes her first appearance in the restaurant when Matt saracen before he started playing as a quarterback and his friend Landry try to talk to her in the dining hall they're like oh that's the coach's daughter but they would still want to like hit on her or you know have a meal with her at the same time. She's portrayed as this
 pretty girl who is the coach's daughter so he's like she has this like kind of out of reach kind of feeling out of reach kind of feeling where I guess it was boys watching a show and she is really she's a really good dancer and she looks kind of younger actually than like other people and she says that she's not going to date any football coach I mean any football players when she first appears which is interesting well given that she is the coach's 
 daughter but recently she has been getting more familiar and friendly with Matt saracen who is the new quarterback obviously and I feel like that what she said at the beginning was when she first appeared is sort of like a foreshadowing to the fact that she will date him in the future although it hasn't happened it hasn't happened yet I think her relationship with her father as also father and mother is also pretty interesting given that she is  
 pretty obedient to the family to the to her parents but she and she's like she's willing to help with anything like putting like a party a garden party that she her mom had to throw at the house and like buying new stuff but she also is like not completely obedient because she makes this defiant face and sometimes she goes out of her way to do things that she wants to do. Yeah."
SID000820,LandryClarke,"Okay, Landry Clark is the one of the few people few guys in this movie who are not on the football team I mean not movie TV show. He's Matt saracens best friend not a football player I guess just a regular student who is according to Matt Saracen's Grandma a bad influence to Matt ... he is judging from the scene where he tried to talk to Julie Taylor at
 the restaurant and got rejected yeah I could see that he could be a bad influence because he's not like a very uptight like good boy like Matt Saracen is but I do feel like he's a good friend to him like he helps Matt practice and memorize all the formations in football as a quarterback and he's very encouraging he believes that Matt can do whatever he puts his mind to well Coach said that but  
 I'm sure he thinks that too. ... He has been really appearing in the shows like in the end of three or four episodes three and four lately because as Matt is more involved into the football and also with Julie he doesn't have much of a role but I'm curious to see like what kind of role he will play like why they put him in the first place 
 because yeah he must have a role too and I don't remember that much about him ... He seems kind of yeah mediocre."
SID000820,LylaGarrity,"Okay first off I think she is really pretty I don't know other than why other characters in the TV show think Tyra is prettier but yeah that's just my type I guess she's also stereotypical character because she's like the cheerleader she's really pretty, she's a brunette, she looks like ? and smart. She has a rich father and a perfect boyfriend who she's going to be getting married and it's going to and I guess sort of the same way that Jason Street's 
 future and mr. typical this got ruined like her hers also got ruined when Jason Street got into this accident and she no longer has a perfect boyfriend and now she's conflicted and she's like as like a good girl would do I guess the stereotype would do like she tries really hard to support her boyfriend and and and make him believe that he's going to be able to recover and everything's will everything will be back to normal again. And she prays to  
 God of course she's religious and yeah but the fact is it's just like not the same anymore because he's injured and they can't hang out or have the same dynamic as they used to. I was actually kind of surprised when she saw Tim and then they started making out in front of the car and like in the street but yeah I guess they're now interested in each other
 I think that is pretty funny and what's going to happen to Tyra now I don't know cuz she also has a boyfriend I mean he also has a girlfriend but yeah now her perfect stereotypical good girl status is ruined and she's going to try rash things and break up with Jason I guess... or maybe not."
SID000820,MattSaracen,"Matt saracen is the main character of the show he is a star quarterback well rookie quarterback now that Jason Street has been injured and no longer can take the role and he is like the type of person that the audience will cheer for because he has his personal hardships going on including a that such as he is poor he lives in a small house with only his grandma
 he works a lot in the local restaurant to pay for I'm guessing living expenses and stuff like that he take care he takes care of his grandma very well and which is going to be problematic in the future because it looks like she has dementia and she he is sort of embarrassed of his poor house as you can tell when coach Taylor was going in and she tried to stop him from coming in and like talk outside 
 but at the same time he is a really good kid and he really enjoys and he is very hardworking and practices and he likes football this is he is going to grow I feel along with the rest of the team and becoming like become like close friends with Coach Taylor and yeah. He also has affectionate feelings 
 toward Julie Taylor who is the coach's daughter but he is the type of per-, he is the type of the guy that father's would approve of especially like coach Taylor knowing Matt Saracen well so I don't think there's going to be too much of a hardship there and yeah they look really cute together his friend his grandpa thinks disapprove of his friend and yeah he does seem like he's like he could be a bad influence but he doesn't spend as much time with him anymore."
SID000820,SmashWilliams,"Okay Smash Williams is I don't know much about football but I can't tell that he's the second most good person in football other than Jason Street who got bedridden, the runnerback or something like that and he is definitely like an alpha male in this football team now that Jason Street is gone and that's that's part of the reason he creates some conflict with Tim who is Jason's best friend and also like another player in the football team. He has
 Smash and Tim has many like rivalry rivalries going on including about the one about Tyra because I think Smash also has a crush on Tyra and about like who is going to be like the new leader after Jason street is gone. Obviously Matt Saracen he will like grow to be that leader at some point but he can't do it right now because he's a sophomore and inexperienced and he talks very loudly and clearly that he wants to be this 
 leader and he was in the dining hall like talking about this about this talking about his plans to be the new leader and which got Tim really angry and they were they almost ran into a fist fight in the dining room. Obviously he's not a character that most people would like which I think is kind of problematic because again like this TV show is putting him into the stereotype, stereotypical kind of violence black male who is going to be like a I guess 
 an antagonistic figure to the main character sort of and I I don't know that's that's just sounds kind of wrong to me. Another another interesting thing was that he was interested in Tyra who is who is Tim's girlfriend and she he brought her to his house and his mother kicked her out and then she didn't even give her a drive so that was a pretty funny scene maybe they'll get back they'll get together at some point. I don't..."
SID000820,TamiTaylor,"You know what now that I think about it all the characters in this TV show is really stereotypical and she Tami Taylor is also a very stereotypical character. I mean I guess people like like it more or if it's like stereotypical and they can assume a lot of things or maybe people will enjoy it more or maybe like to Future TV shows can remake them but anyway she's really stereotypical like a wife of a coach she's really supportive of his husband and she's a
 counselor and she likes thinks compassion is the best way to go whereas her husband barks at them and of course like women are for sympathizing and like being counselor and all and she's also really stressed about like cooking and she like attends this like weekly meeting like book club meetings with other moms other women as well yeah it's a very stereotypical character but she... 
 and another stereotypical thing is that she loves her husband even still even though he sometimes disrespects her, they love each other very much and they're having a healthy relationship. She also loves her daughter and she relies her daughter for a lot of things they are like friends a lot of the times and they talk to each other and yeah they like go to the grocery shopping together to like prepare for the garden party and stuff. I think  
 she could be more of playing an important role like in the later episodes because when Coach Taylor is having a harder time like with maintaining the kids or like sometimes it's especially if there's a conflict just coming up like with a new quarterback and Tim and Smash and stuff and people like that and she might be able to play a role in calming her down coming him down and other students down as well also interesting to see how she'll react to ..."
SID000820,TimRiggins,"Tim Riggins is also the other problem kid for Coach Taylor he always shows up drunk or like sort of borderline like like in like as if he was drinking and his first scene was he was like making out with his girlfriend in the sofa and his brother older brother was telling him to really care about his future and he just doesn't. So... yeah, problem kid. 
 He's also the best friend of Jason Street who was the star quarterback from the show ... and I think he feels bad that he got injured like Jason Street got injured so badly and he feels that he should have tried harder to stop that quarterback I mean stop that ball from going touchdown and help the quarterback somehow so that he wouldn't have gotten injured. Which obviously doesn't make any sense but yeah he still feels bad.  
 And that's the reason that he becomes even more problematic and he starts like not showing up to practice is sometimes I think Taylor's said and he doesn't even make a visit to his girl, not girlfriend, his boy, no, best friend in the hospital and Jason is also kind of annoyed at him because of that. I don't really exact exactly understand his reasoning like why he's like why he has to be so problematic or like why he's so look so sad all the time 
 when he is doing pretty well I feel like. I guess the other thing is that he's now making out with Lyla and he cannot stop thinking about her so he shows up in her room and starts making out even though he has a girlfriend. I feel like Tyra might know because she was visiting Jason Street in the hospital and she was like I'm sure she feels she feels really bad but now maybe they're going to go out instead."
SID000820,TyraCollette,"Okay Tyra Collette is the last of the three young male I mean the female characters and she's the most probably the most stereotypical of them all she's the hottest girl in school blonde, tan, wears revealing clothes and accessories she has a boyfriend but she's like really flirty with everyone... yeah and everyone like looks at her when she goes passes by stuff like that. ...
 To be honest I don't really know what she wants because she for Jason maybe she likes Jason because before Jason got injured she tried to talk to him and get a picture with him before Lyla comes like and to make Lyla angry I guess. And she also like flirts with other guys such as Smash and yeah just as Smash.... 
 I think so far like you don't really know what she wants because she hasn't been talking that much like of her mind or she hasn't like really had a conversation I guess which is also kind of stereotypical. The scene with like when she was visiting Smash's house and getting kicked out of the house because Smash's family were coming in that was pretty funny especially when she expected her to 
 give a ride and I mean, she she expected his mother to give her a ride and she totally just told her to just walk ... yeah I don't find her very interesting but ... yeah."
SID000499,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy is kind of the... almost he's got like a villain vibe to him, I don't know why but he seems like a prominent sort of businessman in the town like like it seems like he runs the Chamber of Commerce or something and because the town's obsessed with this stupid football game 
 he is also obsessed in a weird way like there's no like there's no real reason for his weird obsession but he puts a lot of pressure on the coach to win games in a way that makes it seem like he has something to gain or lose from the outcome so that's why he comes across as kind of a villain.  
 It seems like he's willing to go to any means necessary to help the team win for some reason not because I don't get the sense that it's because he wants the team to win and cares about the kids but it seems like he's got something something personal to gain from their winning or something personal to lose when they're losing I don't know if he's got money bet on it, I don't know if he has like a weird like 
 addiction he's gotta support but that's how frantic he is about wanting the team to win it's bizzare and creepy and doesn't actually make much sense logically but he's Lyla Garrity's dad and doesn't seem to care about that fact only that the team wins and yeah... he's creepy and he's got weird hair."
SID000499,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor I think this is his first year coaching the team and he's constantly stressed out because of all the pressure he's under the town for some reason. He seems to be a good coach he's really interested in like making personal connections with his players.
 He had a very close relationship with Jason Street before he was injured and then after Jason Street was injured, he sort of ditched him and started investing in the new guy because all he seems to care about his football even though he's totally neglecting his family and he's but  
 he also moreso is invested in like the development of his players and now wants to be like a mentor to them even though he's not really a mentor to his own daughter, probably for sexist reasons and yeah he's just really stressed out all the time and feels very personally responsible for the well-being of the players and is doing a terrible job of  
 balancing his home and work life but in the show I think the idea is to make it seem like he has a real close personal investment and actually cares about the students' development and ya know loves the kids."
SID000499,JasonStreet,"Jason was like the star of the town he was like the quarterback that everybody loved and I guess was known for being a good quarterback and has a really close relationship with the coach I suppose they've known each other for a long time and it's like he was sort of a mentee to the coach and 
 sort of at one point the coach said something to the effect of like 'you're the reason I wanted a coach' or something like that so they have a strong bond and everyone loves him. Until he played a little too hard that one time and got paralyzed. So he's been in the hospital for most of the show and just beginning to regain some of the you know arm arm strength. Started out in there pretty optimistic he's very polite by  
 nature so started really optimistic and pretty quickly realized or was coming to grips with the fact that he may not walk again otherwise totally wholesome loves his little girlfriend and everbody loves him and he's perfect except he's paralyzed. what else he is angry now or 
 frustrated with his you know health, inability to you know, move, understandably, you know sometimes he gets frustrated and disillusioned and hopeless if you will, but I think by nature he's still very polite well mannered guy that everybody likes."
SID000499,JulieTaylor,"Julie Taylor, I think that's her name, she is coach Taylor's daughter and daughter of Tami Taylor the guidance counselor, she is 15 so I guess she's probably a sophomore she is not as interested in football as the rest of the town actually, doesn't seem
 really interested at all in football as the rest of the town which makes her seem I guess more involved intellectually then her surroundings she's just unfazed by all the hype and can't be bothered which is why why she tells Matt Saracen that she doesn't want to sit with football players. She sometimes gets frustrated with her dad or parents for putting football ahead of their 
 daughter and feeling like second best or second place to football but she's still really patient and seems to support them like when she helped put the barbecue party thing she likes to dance, she's in dance classes or something which I guess contributes to why she might seem more artistic and involved. She's not a very good dancer but I guess that's not a part of the plot,  
 I guess the plot is that she's more of an artist than a football-head that's why she can have conversations about Jackson Pollock at fifteen which I suppose is pretty advanced, I don't know. But overall she just kind of above it all as she should be cuz it's just football but I think that's her perspective."
SID000499,LandryClarke,"Landry has a weird name doesn't look like he does much laundry but he is a pretty one-dimensional character he's sort of a not even a side kick just around he's on the homely side which explains kind of why he's really a periphery since high school is really vapid like that.  
 He looks like, you know, he or seems like he doesn't really probably not actively picked on but kinda sits at the weird kids table and certainly isn't the most personable he just seems like he's kind of always around but not necessarily wanted there. Aloof and doesn't know that. Matt Saracen's best friend but I don't think Matt Saracen really considers him  
 a friend and just settles on Landry because he's too shy to talk to most people They're really interested in girls is most high school boys are but realistically he's not going to get lucky with any of them anytime soon and yeah probably smells weird 
 but his name is Landry you could say he's like the voice of unreason in Matt's head because he really adds no value to you any conversation he's been apart of throughout the show so I hope he grows up cuz he's kind of ..."
SID000499,LylaGarrity,"Lyla Garrity is Buddy's daughter she's like a pretty well-known cheerleader, I would say head cheerleader if that's a thing. She is the girlfriend of the starting quarterback Jason Street and she is very proper sort of perfect at least sort of gives that impression off.   
 I get the sense that a big part of her sort of identity is tied to her relationship to the quarterback being a cheerleader being perfect having a I think she has a nose job but for being Christian she's also Christian so a lot of that sort of Christian guilt kind of vibe going with her. But, she does slip up    
 and so she feels really guilty about that which was probably why she so why she appears to be so loyal to Jason and she just I don't know she doesn't like change or something, she just wants everything to go back to the way it was because the way it was she had all these roles where she was perfect and everything was perfect and she's actually not, she's kind of a ho. She makes out with her boyfriend's best friend and  
 tries to make herself feel better about it by being nice and speaking in a high voice and having everyone like her and think she's perfect yeah so maybe some good intentions but just kind of a not believable character like she just seems fake. It's pretty obvious."
SID000499,MattSaracen,"Matt Saracen is a sophomore started as like a backup quarterback didn't really play much is really a peripheral football player until Jason got paralyzed and then the coach was forced to just put him in turned out he did pretty good and everybody thought it was a fluke but after a couple games, he ends up not being that bad at it and wants to be better.  
 He is pretty mild-mannered yes sir no sir takes care of his grandma so I guess we we're meant to be very empathetic or sympathetic with him as a character he looks way older than 15 and has a crush on Julie the coach's daughter. But of course is super shy to try to speak to her   
 but makes a random connection between her dancing and art some painting and so so I guess he knows about more than just football he works at an ice cream place or something so he wears a lot of hats between football school his job and taking care of his sick grandma he has virtually no sort of guidance from his 
 dad is in Iraq at war somewhere ... and ... I think he is just really eager to please others which is why he succumbs to peer pressure and wrecks the car. And also..."
SID000499,SmashWilliams,"Smash is a walking stereotype he is supposed to I don't know like like rap rap music that's why they asked him to rap a terrible rap thing apparently he's sort of church-going that's why they make him lead some prayer at some point he's  
 sorta got a bit of a chip on his shoulder as they say so yeah just a very racist stereotype. Seems kind of like a token character they present his family and his mom but in a way that makes it look like they live in some public housing thing which was weird. He's into the ladies which is a   
 thing and he likes you know pretty girls like Tyra who he flirts with often and at some point they insinuated a threesome between three high school students which was bizarre. But otherwise he has an issue with Tim Riggins I don't know why but they do not get along but the general Smash feels like a  
 bit of a token character until the new quarterback from New Orleans comes along and then he's somehow threatened because in another problematic way and it's like their pitting them against each other and it's just all problematic but other than that he seems happy go lucky he goes to parties and is not intimidated by others."
SID000499,TamiTaylor,"Tami Taylor is the wife of the head coach for the football team she starts off the season I guess without a job I guess she's bored or something cuz her daughter's getting older cuz then she decides she wants a job so she gets one as a guidance counselor and I don't know I guess she's independent cuz she took it without consulting her husband and
 now she's a guidance counselor and she struggles with being the wife of this local celebrity and I get the sense that she wants her husband to be more present in the family that has to like sacrifice her happiness sometimes because the football team comes first and so she has to present herself really well even if 
 she's not feeling kind of very happy. She has a daughter and I think she considers herself pretty literate cuz she went to that book club and read the book that no one actually cared about so maybe she doesn't get along with other other moms she has a different set of priorities it seems. Football may not be at
 the top of that list but it's important to her I think because it's important to her husband and she's pretty patient with how negligent he seems to be he's just giving everything up for football and she got really stressed out when she had to throw a party, understandably."
SID000499,TimRiggins,"Tim Riggins is plays some position in football he is Jason Street's best friend or former best friend and he is wild emo and brooding and it might be because like his parents died or something and that's why he lives with his brother but he has no parents to speak of  
 so that could be the reason why he's kind of an emotional wreck. He seems pretty apathetic about most things, probably because of his dead parents. But appears to be a pretty talented football player although he doesn't care and so the coach always tries to like talk some sense into him in this sort of cheesy you're Your Own Worst Enemy kind of way 
 he does feel a tremendous amount of guilt for Jason's injury even though it seems like it had absolutely nothing to do with him and so maybe he's just a person who carries guilt pretty easily and I guess drinks the guilt away. He was Tyra's boyfriend but since he feels so guilty about injuring Jason, 
 I guess he's making up for it by kissing his girlfriend now and kind of having feelings for his best friend's girlfriend who he believes he paralyzed so I don't how that makes sense I guess a bit of self-sabotage to his character but for the most part yeah, brooding, emotional wreck, self-sabotage sort of guy."
SID000499,TyraCollette,"Tyra is Tim's girlfriend and she's kind of an enabler of his drinking problem she doesn't seem to do anything to stop it she I kind of like her she's very sexually liberated I'll say and just doesn't subscribe to anyone's idea of  
 how a high school girl should act or dress or talk and so she's a bit of a firecracker is the word she sometimes gets frustrated with Tim for being so emo and drinking all the time but not so much that she won't leave him because she does and then promptly starts  
 messing around with Smash she is not very sentimental she's almost bothered by it, she doesn't seem to care about football as much as people around but she does to some extent because she does go see Jason in the hospital and yeah yeah she just seems like over it, unfiltered.  
 I guess. And real like when those girls are crying and she called them out for not even knowing the guy that's pretty real. But I don't know, she's got kind of a rebellious nature to herself sure she's nuanced in that sense. Yeah."
SID000584,BuddyGarrity,"I remember that he's Lyla's father and he was always around on the football field with all the coaches and for some reason I didn't really like him because I don't know, he just gave me a weird vibe, and like I knew that he didn't believe in Matt because he tried to get some other kid from like New Orleans whose family was really messed up by Hurricane Katrina to like get on the team so he wasn't really listening to Coach Taylor about anything, just doing his own thing and I don't know, I just feel like 
 he was very pushy as a person and he probably thought that he was always right ... I don't know, I just feel like he wasn't really involved with his family a lot like I remember there was this one scene where like, he was like talking about 
 Lyla and he was just telling, like he was just saying like 'Give her time, give her time', but I don't know if he was saying that like just because he felt bad or because he didn't really care and he just felt like 'oh you know she'll get over it eventually'... yeah I just remember him with that incident about the kid that they called voodoo about getting him to play as  
 QB one shows like especially you can just tell that he probably only cares about football and himself because he wants to get, quote unquote like the best quarterback since Jason was in the hospital. Yeah, that's pretty much all I remember. ..."
SID000584,CoachTaylor,"Okay so, I understand where Coach Taylor is coming from you know he likes his team to be the best, but I do think there are different ways he could have gone about it instead of like yelling at them like you know maybe show a little bit of compassion for them cuz a lot of them do come from like rough backgrounds as well like the new quarterback ?? isn't the only who's had like ???? family like in trouble like for example, like 
 Matt I don't know where his mom is I don't think they have ever said anything about his mother but his dad's in Iraq and his grandmother which I have a weird feeling is like dying slowly, he's just going to be all alone having to fight ?? like I don't know. .... Yeah, like, I just think that 
 he's a good coach and like he knows what he has to do in order to go get his players to do what he wants which I think like a lot of coaches tend to do stuff like that like you know they yell at you but at the end of the day they end up like producing a lot of the legit athletes which I think is cool.... yeah... he said he's a pretty good husband and a dad asides from the fact that when he's  
 thinking about football all of that like clouds his judgment just like he forgets everything but when he's not around football, I can tell that he's very family oriented...."
SID000584,JasonStreet,"Yes I think in terms of Jason like I think he's a really good person he was the star player before he  ended up getting hurt, which I thought was pretty sad because like when I watched it like I really thought he wouldn't have gotten so like badly hurt like that was pretty interesting to see. I know he has his moments because he knows like he may not ever be able to walk again and it just seems like people are like ignoring the reality of the fact that like you know he won't be able to use his legs again
 yeah I just think that he's a really strong person I can say, strong in terms of yeah just like I'm so sorry ...  
 I'm trying to think about Jason and stuff like at this point in the show like he's just stuck in the hospital like with a crazy roommate who seems to like bully him and  
 I just thought it was very interesting how he ended up like getting his his feeling back in his hand by hitting the bottle down like that just shows that like you know he's getting back his strength slowly but surely. Yeah, that's pretty much it. ..."
SID000584,JulieTaylor,"Okay so I really like Julie I thought she was pretty quiet and like to me she was low-key like a background character kinda she didn't really serve much of a role, she was just like a regular teenage daughter, she had her moments. But I could tell that she really liked Matt because he came to her dance recital and you know she's kind of happy I always feel like she's like unsure of her feelings for him and like she just doesn't want to admit  
 that she likes him but to me I think she likes him. She's very helpful around the house like I know I know she's very helpful with her mom came when it came to the party that they had to have like she literally wasn't even in the party for like a minute she was getting breakfast foods and like other foods from the supermarket for her mom. I can also tell that she's pretty emotional cuz when her father forgot about her dance recital she was pretty mad and he had to tell his wife to like tell her that he apologized... and 
 ... yeah I just feel like really likes to dance... yeah she's just a pretty helpful person when it comes to like her family... yeah..."
SID000584,LandryClarke,"Okay so I remember that he was he was he was one of Matt's well, Matt's best friend, he was always around so I kind of feel like I really liked him because you know he was like, he's kinda like Matt's sidekick if you think about it cuz he's always together always telling him like always giving him his insight, he's always at his house which kind of reminded me of my best friend of mine like I just felt that he really is a good kid cuz
 he, you know he hangs around Matt and that's a really good kid. Yeah, I just remember him like I don't think he's plays any sports actually but because Matt is on the football team he automatically associates himself with the football players which I think is pretty funny. And, yeah I just feel like he's
 like he's part of Matt's family cuz I know Matt is pretty lonely aside from having his grandmother there like Landry is the only guy that he can actually confide in and tell stuff to and that's basically his best friend. I think it's really nice. Yeah I don't really remember much about Landry because every time I saw him he was with Matt, he just did 
 he would just do whatever Matt did. He would give Matt advice on certain things, but he's still pretty quiet a lot like pretty low-key ..."
SID000584,LylaGarrity,"Okay so I already spoke about Lyla because I ended up missing who was on the current on the screen at the time so there's not really much to say, just going off of what I said before, I just think she ended up kissing Tim because she's not like in her right mind in terms of like she's trying to get Jason all this hope that he's going to walk again and play football but at this point Jason's just like accepting   
 the fact that you know there may be a possibility that he's never going to do any of this stuff again and she's just trying to be a good girlfriend and like encouraging him and motivating him and like inspiring him to actually like try and get full use of his hands to get him to go to therapy and get use of his legs and feet. And yeah, she's just a very positive person, tryna like get things on his side   
 just to see how he's able to do things ...  yeah I just feel like I don't know if she's doing it just because she's a nice person or because she feels obligated to, I think she's just a genuinely like nice person cuz even when, when what's his name, Tim said something about  
 like not wanting to go with her and she just said you know I'd appreciate it if you didn't disrespect me and she said it like in such a really nice way which is why I also did like her I just feel bad for her. ..."
SID000584,MattSaracen,"... So I really love Matt like he was basically my favorite character in the entire well from what I've seen so far because he's like so humble and so quiet and like he does have a hard life like not having his father there and having a grandmother who's basically suffering from like dimensia and he basically has to be like the man of the house and man down all of these like  
 like friends prop possibly and like maybe ?? I don't know but I think he's just a really good person and like felt really bad when he ended up getting beat up for trashing the QB on the other teams car because he was literally he it just happened that he ended up getting caught, but he wasn't that was actually like smashing stuff, but I still feel like he's a great character and I think, I think  
 if I were to continue watching like I might see a lot of character development cuz I know he really wants to be QB-1 but like with this new kid I don't know how he's going to end up doing it but I also think that he's just an overall like great person and that a lot of people hopefully will end up counting on him or I hope that you know because of him, people end up winning, that would be really great. 
 ...Yeah he's just a really soft-spoken guy and really nice so that's why I think he was my favorite character..."
SID000584,SmashWilliams,"Okay so I'm kind of conflicted about Smash because I thought he was pretty cool like you know he had like kinda like bad guy lke bad boy persona but at the same time like he and Tim always had like issues like I feel like Smash kind of like thought he was better than everybody else in a way cuz I remember there's this this scene where they're like in the diner and he was saying how he was gonna carry the Panthers to like the championship or something because Jason's in the hospital
 and he also had sex with Tim's girlfriend or like he almost did and like his mom walked in or something ... but I really like him and like his determined nature cuz I remember when Coach Taylor made them all come out to ... like on the school bus when they all had to like run around in the rain and he ended up saying like the motto, like their motto and then they all started running again so he kind of gave them like the encouragement  
 and so I can tell there's like issues there's like a bittersweet relationship between him and Coach Taylor but I have a feeling the Coach really likes him and Smash really does like the coach too but sometimes you know they just have their differences, their disagreements and stuff, but it seems like they're able to resolve it...   
 I think ... I think that's all he's done besides like assisting wrecking the QB's on the other teams like car like I could tell he's somewhat malicious but somewhat like soft he's like a blend of both like he doesn't like he gets into trouble when it comes to like authority figures like he doesn't want to be in trouble which I think is pretty interesting."
SID000584,TamiTaylor,"Okay so I actually missed who was on the screen I like blinked or closed my eyes for a second so I guess I'll just assume I'll talk about a character I haven't talked about yet Lyla, so I really like Lyla I love her voice number one like she sounds so sweet and you can tell she's just a really nice person and that you know that she really loves Jason and I felt really bad for her when
 he ended up like basically kicker her out of his room but I know I know exactly how she feels cuz I've been in a position like that like you're trying to get someone to believe something but like you know like it's factual like doctors have told him he's never going to walk again and I do believe in miracles which is the same thing as she said but no like some things are just damaged beyond repair and it sucks but sometimes you just gotta, gotta face it. But,  
 I really do like her cuz she was just like really sweet but I just thought it was really sad how she ended up making out with Tim like letting him do whatever because now it's like that guilt is going to be in the back of her mind whenever she sees Jason and that's basically his best friend but I know like emotions were running really high in that moment which is why they ended up doing that and they just couldn't control themselves and like she was in the dispair and he was in dispair so I guess like finding comfort in
 one another like just two broken people like once you put them together you make them whole again so I guess that's also why she just didn't like she just let it happen like I know she said she didn't want it to continue to happen but I mean once he kept saying he couldn't stop thinking about her I feel like I feel like she's feeling the same way that she can't stop thinking about him but she's only like seeing Jason."
SID000584,TimRiggins,"... So I'm also pretty conflicted about Tim because he also has like this weird persona and you can tell that he's going to be a crazy alcoholic when he gets older because he's just like I feel like everytime he's at some social function he's always drinking and he was like drinking so much on that edge that he was using them as like golf balls 
 and the fact that like you know Jason is his best friend but he hasn't even like gone to see him yet which I thought was ??  cuz I know like, personally, if my best friend were to get up in a hospital like that, I would have to come over there or something and I think that a thing that changed his mind, just changed him itselft was the fact that he and Lyla ended up like 
 making out and like having sex type thing which to me says a lot about how they both are going through some like crazy emotions right now in terms of Jason and they just ended up finding comfort in each other that tends to happen a lot like you know they find comfort in like the the best friend's friend or like the best friend's sister of the best, best friend's girlfriend like they ended up finding their they ended up finding their...  
 finding out yeah he ended up finding all about what's her name Tyra and Smash which I thought was crazy like rumors well I mean it wasn't a rumor because they did actually like get together kinda but like it;s just crazy to see how fast like word goes around cuz a lot of people have been like looking at her I guess so maybe that's why oh I mean not a lot of people have been looking at her so she wasn't sure how he found out."
SID000584,TyraCollette,"Okay so I remember that Tyra was Tim's girlfriend and it seems like her, Tim, Lyla, and Jason all used to hang out together because there was a scene where like they were all together like sitting down at a party or something, I don't remember. And I feel like she really does love Tim but she sees that he's still a very like self-destructive person and int terms of like
 to me it seems like he's an alcoholic and she just really cares for him which is why even when she was like 'oh like we should break up' she felt like she was really hurt but she eventually actually did leave ... I liked her and I kinda felt bad for her because like I understand how she feels about him and how like he just won't change 
 and I remember she actually went to the hospital to see Jason which I thought was really sweet because she even told of that like you know Tim still hasn't come see you yet, and she apologized for it and you know she wasn't being fake about anything cuz she even told him, she was like, you know I know a lot of people are coming here, people who don't even know you, like Jason Street this, Jason street that and you know she was telling him she wasn't going to be like that becuase  
 she still does know him she decided to actually come in and you know see him which I thought was really nice that she, you know she still came to see somebody who was still part of like a breakup for someone who was close to her boyfriend which I thought was really sweet of her to do that even if it was just for a little bit you know she showed face, showed her respects for him"
SID000824,BuddyGarrity,"There's not a whole lot to say about Buddy Garrity he is Lyla Garrity's dad, Lyla's the girlfriend of Jason Street. Buddy Garrity also owns the car dealership in the town and is very close with the mayor and with you know like that boost he's like one of the boosters for the Dillon Panthers he wants Matt saracen to be replaced by Voodoo 
 and he like kind of facilitated Voodoo being recruited to the Dillon Panthers after his family was displaced from Katrina. He's like probably the most conniving character of the show just because he he like really wants to get what he wants and he wants to shape the team to be the way he wants it to be and he cares a lot about winning and he doesn't like the way that coach Taylor is managing the team 
 for the most part and he kinda tries to push coach Taylor around and he also said that Lyla will get over Jason Street eventually and that she's you know she she won't love him and he can't walk and what-not. ..."
SID000824,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor is the coach of the Dillon Panthers he got the position because he groomed Jason Street and he was chosen to like lead the season for the Panthers because him and Jason Street work so well together. There was already a lot of pressure on him and like a lot of the town put a lot of expectation on it because of how good of a quarterback Jason Street is and then went Jason Street got paralyzed everyone disagreed not everyone but a lot of people disagree with Coach Taylor on
 actually keeping Matt Saracen as quarterback and that caused like coach Taylor to have a lot of expectation on him to keep the team winning even though like the odds for winning look pretty grim. Coach Taylor deals with the pressure pretty well and like he he doesn't give in to what people wanted to do but he like does he has a ton going on between being the coach of panthers, his wife, his daughter,
 and then all the like other people in the town like the mayor and the the owner of the car dealership who have a lot of say because they're boosters of the of the team and so they have a lot of say in what decisions are made and are trying to persuade him to do one thing or another like bring in the new quarterback Voodoo to replace Matt Saracen but Coach Taylor hasn't necessarily given although he's given in a little bit by even entertaining the idea of bringing in the new quarterback 
 He seems like a very like he's a good guy he's a nice guy and he gives everyone what seems like a fair shot so ..."
SID000824,JasonStreet,"Jason Street was the first string quarterback for the Dillon Panthers he was like the best quarterback in Texas given that he was the quarterback for the Dillon Panthers which were like the best team in Texas the best high school team. He wanted to play for the Dillon Panthers and then go on to play in college and then as he planned to  
 play in the NFL he was like groomed by Coach Taylor, Coach Taylor got the head coach job because he had groomed Jason Street and Jason Street and him work so well together. Jason Street got injured well he got paralyzed during the opening game of the season and he's in the hospital and can't move his legs. He's a nice kid but he was very full of himself
 because he was so good at football and also there was like so much expected of him. He dates this girl who he likes a lot but he realizes like it's not going to last as long as he's paralyzed especially since he might not be able to walk again. He deals with like the whole like being paralyzing thing pretty well but he still obviously like I don't think it's set in yet   
 that he of what has like actually happened that he can't play football again. He also like is nice about Matt Saracen and he's not like jealous that or upset that he's the first quarterback after he got paralyzed, he's like rooting for him to actually do well and he cares a lot about the team and doesn't necessarily make the team all about himself even though everyone makes the team only about Jason Street."
SID000824,JulieTaylor,"Julie Taylor is coach Taylor's daughter, she's in high school but she's younger she's like she must be in 10th grade or 10th or 11th. She Matt Saracen likes her and I think she she knows it but she doesn't really either like him back or she doesn't think that she's supposed to like people on the football team back or like them at all,
 so she kind of avoids him and like turns him away she feels like she's ignored in the house because all coach Taylor and his wife talk about his football and him being the captain of the football team and all he cares about is the football players but he doesn't really care that much about her. And that was kind of shown like when he forgets about her dance recital which is like the one thing she does and he doesn't even care enough to really to remember that. 
 She's... there's not like a whole lot to her she's pretty simple she also like helps her mom like with whatever her mom asked her to do she does without question like when they're throwing the football team a party before the big rivalry game she goes out and like gets all the stuff that the mom needs because the Coach Taylor the Dad forgot to get it at the grocery store 
 and also because he didn't well he didn't forget to get it at the grocery or he didn't say that that many people were coming so she went and got all the stuff that was needed to prepare like about food for a hundred plus people"
SID000824,LandryClarke,"I really don't know anything about him other than that he is somehow connected to Matt Saracen I don't know if it's because he is like a cousin or something but they're really good friends and he's always trying to get like Matt Saracen and him to get like girls one way or another at the diner he's always trying to like pick up girls there but now that Matt Saracen is 
 quarterback he notices that they're getting like a lot more girls interested in them than they originally had and so he's trying to leverage that interest whereas Matt Saracen doesn't really he wants to just focus on football and he doesn't really care that more girl's are noticing him, other than Coach Taylor's daughter."
SID000824,LylaGarrity,"Lyla Garrity is the girlfriend of Jason Street and she's also a cheerleader on the Dillon Panthers cheerleader team. She is the daughter of the guy who owns the car dealership the same guy who's trying to get Matt Saracen replaced by Voodoo. Lyla's kind of well she's like
 she's in love with Jason for sure and like she wants to stick with him while he's paralyzed but she's kind of numb to the fact that he's never actually going to probably or at least from what the doctors say be able to walk again and she's so like obsessed with this dream of marrying Jason and then him becoming like an NFL player or something and she that's just most likely not going to happen now but she's not ready to let go of it. 
 So she keeps telling Jason that he can walk and that he will be able to soon and Jason gets mad at her and says that he's never going to and that they are never going to get married. She also cheats on Jason with Jason's best friend who I still don't remember the name of, the one who drinks all the time and who dates Tyra, and she cheats on him and then this guy has feelings for him then she says it was nothing and that she doesn't have feelings for him and that she loves Jason."
SID000824,MattSaracen,"Matt Saracen is the second string quarterback he was put into the quarterback the first string quarterback position after Jason Street got paralyzed in the first game of the season. Matt's Saracen lives with his grandma, I don't know where is Grandpa is, his Dad is in Iraq and his grandma has like dementia and so he has a lot on his plate he's tryna take 
 care of her while at the same time learning how to be the first string quarterback. He also is like nervous about the new quarterback from New Orleans who was like displaced from Hurricane Katrina and so that quarterback is like gunning for the first quarterback position that Matt Saracen is currently in and so he's really like being pressured to perform by Coach Taylor. 
 He also likes Coach Taylor's daughter and Coach Taylor told him to go out and like the girl that he wants but Matt Saracen didn't necessarily want to do that because he wants to date Coach Taylor's daughter. So he's like stuck in a lot of tough positions, with his grandma, his dad, Coach Taylor, Voodoo, and Coach Taylor's daughter. And he's not that good at football person first and foremost  
 but he's getting better. He also he like wants to be part of like the team more than he actually is that's why I went they had like this big rivalry and he was starting as quarterback and he went in like participating in like hitting the enemy team's cars like bashing the cars up which is like out of his character but he did it because he wants to be part of the team."
SID000824,SmashWilliams,"I forget what position Smash plays on team I think he plays wide receiver he's like one of the better players on the team and he's kind of next to Jason Street the second biggest star. Smash is well he he flirts a lot with Tyra he also doesn't like Tim, him and Tim don't get along at all, they actually fought at the diner once.
 Smash doesn't like Coach Taylor as a coach and he like tried to do, he told that to the media and then Coach Taylor forced the entire team to go out in the rain and like do like this intense grueling practice as punishment because of Smash and what he said on TV. Smash is very full of himself."
SID000824,TamiTaylor,"Tami Taylor is Coach Taylor's wife, she originally did not have a job when her Coach Taylor when Coach Taylor got his job as head coach, but she ended up becoming a guidance counselor at the school because she wanted to make more money and I think that or she wanted to make more money for coach Taylor and hersef because they want a new house and also she just wanted a different way to spend her time I think.  
 She was, she was bored before. She is very supportive of Coach Taylor but she's like kind of breaking under the pressure of having to be this like coach's wife with all of these responsibilities like hosting the team and dealing with all the like attention that the team and her husband get around around Dillon and it's like stressing her out more than she thought it would 
 and she doesn't really like it that much but she still like supports Coach Taylor being head coach."
SID000824,TimRiggins,"Tim is on the football team, he's on the Dillon Panthers and I think he plays I think he plays fullback. He is like an alcoholic. he obviously has stuff going on like at home but I don't really know what's happening he has this like older brother who we don't learn much about but who's drinking with him all the time, like older brother or step dad or something like that. Tim is Jason Street's 
 best friend and Tim also dates Tyra. Tyra and Tim don't really like each other that much but Tyra is in love with Tim but Tim is actually in love with Lyla or likes Lyla a lot and Lyla is dating Jason. Tim tells Lyla he likes her but Lyla says that she doesn't like him back and whatever happened between them was just was just a fluke. 
 Tim and Coach Taylor don't get along really well, Tim walked off the field one day when him and Coach Taylor got in an argument and Coach Taylor made Tim walk all the way home from a practice that same night or a few nights later I think. Coach Taylor made him walk home in the rain after the practice to like punish Tim and I think Tim respected that Coach Taylor made him 
 do that at now he's back on the team but he knows that if he does something like that again he'll get kicked off."
SID000824,TyraCollette,"Tyra is one of the girls at the school, at Dillon high school, she also dates Smash or no, excuse me she dates the kid who drinks beer a lot, I forget his name, but she flirts with Smash a lot at the diner and so she kind of she like flirts with a lot of people even though she's dating that other kid she is 
 I guess, kind of perceived to be disloyal and also she just kind of wants to be with whatever guy is like the most popular at the time I think and also she tries to make her boyfriend jealous by like flirting with other guys. She's good friends with Jason Street and his girlfriend but like other than that there's not a whole lot  
 to Tyra. She was caught with Smash by Smash's mom I guess and like because of that the guy who drinks a lot of beer I forget his name, but the guy who drinks a lot of beer and like is on the football team who's the fullback broke up with her and so she was like upset about that and ... 
 she also was mad that he wouldn't go and visit Jason Street in the hospital. Jason street is that guy's best friend so. ..."
SID000826,BuddyGarrity,"So Buddy Garrity is this car dealership owner and at the start of the show he opens this new dealership and invites the football team. He has a really strong entrepeneurial spirit, strong football spirit. He typically invites Coach Taylor for lunch and dinner just to talk about football and essentially a ? to keep football very well so local businesses do well. But he's pretty creative and adventurous and that when he feels that 
 Matt Saracen the first like quarterback won't be successful he on his own with another former coach tries to recruit the New Orleans player Voodoo Tatum or player Tatum and they drive 80 miles out to visit him. He's a very aggressive personality and he's able to bring Coach Taylor to the trip even though, even though  
 like coach is pretty much against it at the start of their conversation. So he's an extremely dedicated football or just obessed with football, and so he's a pretty successfull, likewise he's a pretty successful entrepeneur. He and his family live in a pretty large house, however his family seems somewhat fragmented and they never have family dinners. His daughter Lyla Garrity never seems to want to go to these family dinners.  
 At he same time, he's pretty, pretty like laissez-faire father and when his wife talks to him about Lyla being too obsessed with Jason even though Jason in her mom's eyes is somewhat of a loss of future with his him being paralyzed and he's not particularly worried and thinks Lyla will get bored of Jason in due time. So he's pretty hands-off type parenting. So just like Lyla they are both very dedicated individuals and very ambitious."
SID000826,CoachTaylor,"So Coach Taylor is the coach of the Dillon Panthers at the school it's his first year as a head coach for 6 years he was the Middle School coach and the junior coach. So because he's a new head coach there's a lot of pressure on him from the town who's very much obsessed with football which is almost like a religion for the town so Coach Taylor is under a lot of pressure and he's not from the town either so there are a lot of things he's not aware of 
 and there's about throughout the course of the season. So he coaches the football players, he has a really intimate relationship with the quarterbacks, specifically Jason Street as well as Matt Saracen and other football teams that he coached before he had a really close relationship with the quarterback and he's really good at mentoring the quarterbacks apparently in another town he tranformed one quarterback in over a year because of a lot of pressure he's not    
 a very compassionate character towards the football players at the same time he has a strained relationship with his wife because he gets angry at her a lot and she also gets angry at him but he relies on his wife and his daughter for a lot of support to manage their, his stress as well as managing the other duties of being a football coach and just hosting parties and such. And he's very dedicated to his job and will call football players late at night and do house visits and such. 
 He played football when he was younger but he didn't make it to the NFL so because of that he because of his history with football he's very much experienced in football, but he's extremely dedicated to football and he he acts very fair and believes in every... and believes in the football players but he's very passionate about the team succeeding."
SID000826,JasonStreet,"Yeah so Jason Street is the first like quarterback at the beginning of the season he's a Star Quarterback, really fast, really smart, really good at plays. The entire team, the entire high school, the entire town have their hopes pinned on him to win to bring them to state. So in the very first game he has an intense, major injury that fractured his spine and so he's knocked out of the game and then the second  
 line quarterback Matt Saracen starts to play. So for the rest of the show he's hospitalized is in the hospital or in physical therapy after several episodes we see him learn that he's not going to play football again, he's not even going to walk again. So naturally the entire team is devastated and 
 the high school is devastated and he has many many visits. So his girlfriend is particularly devastated and and has a lot of faith and belief that he'll get better and  
 spends a lot of her time at the hospital with him and trying to encourage him that he'll get better so because of her over-optimism he gets mad at her and yells at her that they're going to break up and she is extremely devastated and leaves however the next day he tells her to forget about that and he says they should get back together. so as time progresses, it's been about a few weeks in the  
 hospital and he's started physical therapy he is increasingly less optimistic and less and less calm about his condition and so when one of his physical therapy roommates bugs him about his condition, he loses it and spills a drink which is a complete contrast to his very calm demeanor but through that event he gets usage of his arms so it appears to have a promising trajectory to get well."
SID000826,JulieTaylor,"So Julie Taylor is the daughter of Coach Taylor. She's 15 years old and attends is still in high school as well. Because she's the coach's daughter either she or her dad has a rule where they doesn't where she doesn't talk to football players so she's pretty strict with her interactions with the other football players. She's very artsy as well and does dance practice and has dance recitals every two weeks. Her mom is very supportive of her dance and her father tries to be  
 when he's not busy. She reads Moby Dick in her free time and likes Jackson Pollock. A general sort of counter to the more sports obsessed students in the TV show. Her mother is Tammy Taylor and together they are more realistic people who keep balance to their her father slash her Tami's wife, like 
 football obsessed coach. And so one of her main story lines throughout the TV show is Matt Saracen who's the second line quarterback that becomes the first line quarterback, is very much interested in her but she's also the coach's daughter so for most of the show she rebuffs him but after he goes to her dance recital she becomes more interested in him and that's when Coach also realizes that the first line quarterback might be interested in her as well. So that forms an interesting 
 and somewhat ironic love pair and antagonism. And the funniest part is that coach had previously told Matt the first line quarterback to date a girl that he's interested in it but he at the time he did not realize that girl was his daughter so when he finds out he's pretty shocked and feels somewhat conflicted. In general she is a minor character, is pretty sassy and holds her dad in line for his..."
SID000826,LandryClarke,"Right, so Landry Clark is this side character who's best friends with Matt Saracen they live in the same neighborhood and he drives Matt to morning practices. They're kind of friends out of convenience, it seems like Matt doesn't really appreciate Landry's presence, but they have no one else to hang with so he they hang out. Landry provides a lot of sassy somewhat rude remarks to Matt but he's very supportive of Matt when 
 Matt becomes first line quarterback has to memorize like a hundred and twenty moves. He's he helps Matt run through them and asks him questions. And so Landry also helps Matt with marketing himself, he's like 'Matt, you're like not the Red Hot Chili Peppers you're something else' and it's kind of a dumb analogy but Matt uses it later on television. Landry is interested in heavy metal, mostly just wants to leave the town, but 
 not sure what skills and resources he has to so spends his time kind of wondering about that. Additionally, he's kind of a, he's a bit of a practical character. So he's talking to Matt when Matt first becomes first line quarterback, he's like 'oh Matt like all these girls and all these like free things are coming to you now like you should take advantage of it', but Matt's like 'oh no that's like amoral since, that's immoral since Jason's lying in bed', but 
 Landry's like 'yeah that's true but this is never going to happen to you again', so he's really like practic- pragmatic and doesn't have like a really strict like fairness or like work ethic code. And in general he's sort of this foil to Matt for Matt to like voice out his ideas and show that Matt is like a very nice, like traditional Christian moral character. And then towards the end Landy has not appeared as much."
SID000826,LylaGarrity,"Right so Lyla Garrity is the other main protagonist high school student. She is the typical good like Christian girl from Texas, goes to church every weekend, makes cookies, and does prayer and such and such. So she's the girlfriend of Jason Street and through the majority of the show she's extremely supportive of him after he gets his injury she goes to the hospital every single day and stays very late, she does bake sales and makes prayer circles for him,   
 she's very dedicated. She's a cheerleader and is like very supportive of the football team and Jason. She envisions herself marrying Jason, and is very close with Jason's parents as well. So that's Lyla Garrity and then at the same time she's also very polite and friendly so she keeps talking to Tom and asks him to come 
 visit Jason and when he gives her sass and flack that she's very patient and very kind towards him. However, she has like this mental break down like halfway through the show when Jason breaks up with her and, so sorry, before I talk about that, she's always like very optimistic about Jason becoming well almost to this point of being unrealistic and being very obnoxious about it so Jason just loses it one day and tells her to stop but being unrealistic and that he won't walk again.  
 And so she is very sad and cries about it and so as she's like having this breakdown she runs into Tom and then she's like 'Why do you never visit?', and like she's very sad about him not walking and then they like start making out and it's like the craziest thing ever. But then she and Jason get back together but she like has feelings for Tom and like they make out later again in her room and it's like this weird love triangle while Jason is in the hospital. So she gets more interesting later in the show."
SID000826,MattSaracen,"So much like Coach Taylor, Matt Saracen is an outsider in the show. He's this underdog quarterback who's from a not particularly rich family and he's second line quarterback at the start of the show, but once after Jason Street's injury he becomes first line quarterback. And he does pretty well in the first game however, because Jason is so well loved, he's like particularly doubted by the town. And then in the second game he does make good plays but ultimately he does not succeed so
 he has a lot of doubt and shade thrown on him by the town. So he's a very interesting character in that he's presented as this like sort of creative, a-typical outsider but he lacks a lot of self-confidence and his like best friend Landry is really deprecating towards him as well which is not super helpful. But he has an interesting family background where his grandma has dementia and no one else is home and his father's in Iraq and then his mother is unaccounted for. So he has a lot on his plate with being the star quarterback, 
 taking care of his grandma with dementia, and having no one at home to give support. And so another interesting story line about him is that he also has a crush on the Coach's daughter who who A he's not supposed to because she's the coach's daughter, B  she has her own personal restrictions against football players and then C the coach inadvertently supports him liking his daughter. And then D the funniest part is throughout the like most of    
 the show is that the coaches daughter like rebuffs him like pretty hard like not a mean way but just like kind of ignores all of his attempts to talk to her. And so he tries really hard from first line quarterback and it appears that he has a lot of potential but unclear if he'll be able to become first line quarterback with the start of a new outsider who's name is Voodoo Tatum who's a really good quarterback from New Orleans."
SID000826,SmashWilliams,"So Smash Williams is arguably the second best player on the team, he's a really good running back and he's good friends with Jason and he's not very good friends with Tom. So because he's black he deals he, Tom, he's asked about whether racism affects him on the team, however he's very determined and seems to ignore it. And because of his, um and Tom apparently doesn't like him, some believe it's racisim,  
 but some believe it's just he doesn't like him. So he's kind of an interesting like party animal who hosts a lot of parties and sees a lot of women and is like this really like chill, fun, dedicated football player. However, because he has a really different personality from Tom they have a lot of conflicts and throughout the show they get in a few fights together. And at one point in the show he makes out but doesn't sleep with Tom's girlfriend, but he's really dumb and didn't lock the door and 
 gets caught by his mom and then his mom like escorts out Tom's girlfriend Tara outside. And Smash seems to be more somewhat of an amoral character who's main aim is just to do well in football and like just be really proud of being a football player but besides that like other qualities don't seem to really shine out and he just seems to be a main counter to Tom and Tom's sort of like uptight, loner attitude 
 and then Smash is like really open free. And then eventually later they become friends with the onset of the new outsider which is the quarterback from New Orleans, named Tatum. And in general, he's not really, his story line's not really discussed much. His father's passed away and he lives with his mother and his little sister he's really sassy yeah he's just really focused on football mostly."
SID000826,TamiTaylor,"So Tami Taylor is the wife of Coach Taylor, in the beginning of the show she was very compassionate and was supportive and patient with her husband's rants and tirades about football, but at the same time she's pretty vocal and assertive and convinces him to look at a house when she that she wants to look at cuz she wants to move in. And she's always generally right in their partnership for example when the AC was broken, he didn't listen to her 
 and checked it out and then later realized she was right. So she's really supportive and generally  right in their marriage. Later she gets a guidance counselor job because she feels that they'll be stayin gin the town longer and while the coach is against it, she does get it so she's a pretty willfull individual, but at the same time she's really good at keeping the peace at times when their daughter gets mad at the coach for not going to dance recital or not being very present.  
 She's very good at communicating between the two and helping smooth over those issues. I'm hoping she's not a pushover and after coach hosts the party at their house and it's like a party with way more people showed up than she planned for she's really angry and really upset however and she gets mad at her husband but he doesn't acknowledge it and later they still get mad, she still continues to be mad at him, but after he realizes he was wrong,   
 they quickly makeup and she forgives pretty easily. So in general, she presents this more, a side of the coach that allows him to display his worries and concerns as well as his thought processes and foils, and she's a foil for that. At the same time she's a more level-headed version of the coach."
SID000826,TimRiggins,"So Tim Riggins, it's not Tom, is Jason Street's best friend that's kind of the counter to Jason. He's not a model student, he's moody, he gets upset, he's aggressive, he's mean, he doesn't listen to others, only does what he wants and he's the defense player on the team. However, he's he's really interesting in that later he falls in love with Jason's best friend Laura, he's like, he's kind of  
 mentally strange like first off he has like an alcohol addiction and comes to practice half drunk, he lives with is brother brother and like they never wear shirts at home, I think his mother's gone and he gets in fights with Smash it has like anger issues and that like his girlfriend Tyra would be was like 'Oh calm down' and he's like 'No I'm mad' and then like throws over Smash and Smash is like 'Oh calm down' and then he's like 'Oh I'm mad' and then throws like a cup at Smash.  
 Anyway, he clearly has like a few, he's a bit, a piece of work as Smash says. And then so later he like falls in love with Lyra after like making out with her once and is like obsessed with her and then like sneaks into her room and makes out with her, like he's really strange but like at the heart he's presented as a kind character and that like after Jason's injury because he's defense he felt that he didn't protect Jason enough and feels really bad  
 that Jason got injured and spends most of the, several scenes, episodes feeling very guilty and trying to release stress for doing that. So he's portrayed as a very caring character, he just has a lot of difficulty with dealing with his emotions and he does he's like very like loyal to the team and that and he listens to the football coach except that one time when he forgot and felt really bad."
SID000826,TyraCollette,"So Tyra is one of the other main female protagonists who are in high school. She is the girlfriend of... the dude Tom... the other football player who feels very guilty about Jason's accident. Anyways, so we're first introduced to her at I think his name's Tom, I'm just going to pretend it's Tom, Tom's place and she like makes out with him and like 
 his brother gives him a lot of sass for that but she like snaps back at him so she's obviously a very vocal and aggressive character. And then throughout the show we see that when someone says something that she finds like strange or inappropriate she's really quick to comment and gossip on it. And she's also very close with the other football players including Smash and Jason and when Tom is very like doesn't talk to her and starts having a fight with her 
 she cheats on him and makes out with Smash. She's considered like extremely attractive like whenever she walks into a room or like meets someone new they always comment on her looks, however she doesn't appear to be presented as a very shallow character she's actually ? as somewhat compassionate. So when Tom refuses to visit Jason in the hospital after several weeks and after several times and Jason's girlfriend Laura asks Tom to visit  
 Tyra goes to the hospital and tells Jason that Tom wants to visit but he can't because that's his personality and she's quite honest and upfront that she like has no real relationship with Jason but out of duty for Tom and feeling very bad for Jason she's doing that. So she has a lot of kindness and compassion. And eventually she breaks up with Tom and..."
SID000829,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy Garrity is father to Lyla Garrity and is a coach of the Panther football team. He seems removed from the action in a lot of ways in the first few episodes. Much of what he says to Coach Taylor is judgement based information on how the team is doing and what coach Taylor needs to do to make things better.  
 Buddy seems removed from a lot of the action as has he's not really seen interacting with the players or checking on how they're feeling but more just standing on the sidelines yelling what he thinks needs to be done. Buddy encourages Coach Taylor to replace Matt Saracen with a quarterback from Louisiana on the basis that that quarterback had won nationals for his team the previous year. Buddy seems a lot more concerned  
 with the status of the team and how they are perceived by other schools as well as their town as opposed to worrying about his players and how they're coping with what has happened and how he can further develop their own skills and make things better for them. He also seems slightly removed from Lyla's destructive behavior as shown in one scene talking to Lyla's mom. Lyla's mom expresses that she's concerned about Lyla's behavior  
 and obsession with constantly seeing Jason and visiting him in the hospital and it doesn't really seem like Buddy responds. ?? as his focus is very much on the team and their status and how the town will perceive him and the other coaches."
SID000829,CoachTaylor,"In addition to being head coach of the Panther football team CoachTaylor is also husband, father, and a source of support and inspiration for all his players. He deals with a lot in the first two episodes of the show, even before Jason's injury he deals with the pressure of organizing the season in such a way that the Panthers continue to win and be
 upheld in rankings inTexas. After Jason's ingury he faces not only backlash from the community in terms of how he is running the team, but backlash from his own team in terms of how he allows Matt to be quarterback, how he's contributing to team unity, and how he chooses to discipline the boys when they act disrespectful 
 whether that be towards him or each other. He does seem to care a lot for the boys in a fatherly way, this is shown by him caring for Matt after Matt is beat up by members of the rival team and bringing Matt with him to his daughter's dance recital and I think that's a great example of how much Coach Taylor juggles in his role as coach and husband and leader for his community. 
 He faces the tough job of balancing being a husband who is attentive, a father who cares, and a coach that's able to provide for his players and it seems like it'll take time for him to find the balance in doing that in a way that's successful and sustainable."
SID000829,JasonStreet,"So Jason Street is the beloved quarterback of the Panthers, he is loved by everyone in the town, he keeps all of his teammates in line, and he's dating the head of the cheer team. During their first home game of the season he gets tackled and suffers a severe injury, he's taken to the hospital and they end up finding out that he's paralyzed
 from the waist down and as episodes go on the viewer gets to see how much this has really affected Jason. Even struggling to move his fingers produces anger in him and he starts to be just frank and rude with people around him including nurses as well as his girlfriend who's trying really tries really hard to 
 keep his spirits up. His character doesn't get too developed in the first few episodes because he does get injured in the first episode, but it's almost like an unspoken rule throughout the first few episodes of the show that he is one of the most important people in the town and that his injury his loss to the team is a great one, that led to a lot of people 
 being upset, just feeling anxious about what would happen next for the Panthers."
SID000829,JulieTaylor,"Julie Taylor is the daughter of Coach Taylor and Tammy Taylor. She seems to be in her own world and very focused on what she's doing in her own life and is wary of other football players. She's a young 15 year old who's very involved in her extracurricular activities such as dance as well as school and really just avoids any advances from boys on the team. This is evidenced 
 in the first episode when Matt I think tries to ask Julie to sit for a meal and she tells him she doesn't catch meals with football players. She does seem to warm up to him as the show goes on towards the end and she maybe sees more of his personality and more of his true intentions. She seems to be very patient with her parents they are both pretty 
 disorganized in a few episodes with everything they are dealing with and pushing a lot of responsibilities and tasks onto her if she handles everything in stride and almost handles them like an adult and just does what is asked of her without questioning anything and she seems to be almost the favorite child in the sense for being so good and remaining so strong with everything else her parents are going through."
SID000829,LandryClarke,"Landry Clarke is much more of a side character in the show. He's best friend to Matt Saracen and the two seem very close especially in the first two episodes. Landry is there to talk to and support Matt with his new role as quarterback he's also there to encourage Matt to talk to girls and 
 in a way act in his position as a leader of the team with his new title. Landry seems to care for Matt in a brotherly way as well and how he spends time with him at his house and cleaning his yard and cleaning up Matt's side after it's it has graffiti on it from either rival teams or people who don't approve. 
 So Landry seems to be a lot more of a point of support in the first few episodes of the show for his best friend Matt who's the main character. Landry's own character isn't developed too well the first two episodes as the focus is on his best friend but he is there just seen supporting and lending an arm to his friend who needs help."
SID000829,LylaGarrity,"Lyla Garrity is the captain of the cheer team and girlfriend to Jason. She is very dedicated to both her teammates but especially Jason after his injury, this is evidenced in how she is there with his family when they're visiting him at the hospital and how she chases after Tim, Jason's best friend, trying to convince him to visit Jason for Jason's sake.  
 Yeah and her constant visits to Jason in the hospital and she even goes as far as to spend her birthday with him. She does seem to start to crack under the pressure of in the third episode when Jason blows up at her and yells at her to leave and she runs into Jason's best friend on her drive home. She ends up crying in his arms and then kissing him.    
 In the fourth episode she tries to stay away from Tim and tells him that what happened between them was a mistake and that she was devoted and dedicated to Jason but it seems that feelings were developed between Lyla and Tim as they do seem to start kissing again in the 4th episode, despite Lyla's previous comments that she felt nothing towards Tim and was in love with Jason. It seems that Lyla  
 struggles so much with keeping up the perfect good girl image and Jason's injury and the rockiness of their relationship starts to get to her as the show progresses."
SID000829,MattSaracen,"Matt saracen is a sophomore on the Panthers football team. He is qb2 and gets thrown into the action at the end of the first episode after Jason gets injured and Matt has to take Jason's place. His father is an Iraq so Matt has a huge responsibility of taking care of his grandmother at the house in addition to all the pressure that starts to follow him once he 
 replaces Jason and everyone on his team and town looks to him not only to perform well but to uplift everyone in the context of everything else that's going around with everyone being so upset about Jason's loss. Matt develops feelings for his coach's daughter and this seems to be a sort of distraction for him as well as other things, but 
 he does take being QB seriously. This is shown when he does decide to go with his teammates and trash a rival team's car and then he refuses to give up the names of his other players to the rival team once they find him. He also ends up dropping a pretty important class in order to make more time for his personal life and taking care of his grandmother, as well as football."
SID000829,SmashWilliams,"Smash Williams really represents the stereotypical jockey football player who wants to advance his own agenda, remain popular, and get with as many girls as possible. He is quite disrespectful towards his coach in a few instances in the first few episodes and towards his others teammates. He really doesn't respect anyone who isn't in line with him and
 what he's doing and this is evidenced by him immediately taking Jason's quote-unquote spot at a local Diner that the entire team goes to shortly after Jason's injury, and this causes some tension between Smash and Jason's best friend Tim. Smash also has relations with Tim's girlfriend which I think shows in a way that he
 does not care much for certain teammates and what they think of him and he is about advancing his own agenda. I will say that in one scene in the third episode, the boys are called for a late night practice and they start to struggle with running up the hill and Smash does seem to rally them all together and after the rival team destroys the Panther's locker room Smash is the one who organizes a retaliation  
 against that team and gets a bunch of teammates to go back to the quarterbacks house and destroy his car. So he seems to put up a front of not caring about anything but maybe deep down, under his facade his character does."
SID000829,TamiTaylor,"Tami Taylor is the wife of Coach Taylor. She faces a lot of pressures being his wife initially just in being a sense of being a source of refuge for him when he's struggling with things on the team and with the town and her role in doing that gets augmented after Jason's accident. Her husband comes under a lot of  
 pressure from the town and she feels the need to make sure she's upholding an image of the wife who is holding the family together and who's there for her husband I think this is shown in her deciding to go to book club meetings that she doesn't seem to actually have much interest in but she does want to have good relationships with the mothers of the other sons of the other players on the
 football team. When Coach Taylor springs a house party on Tammy she gets very stressed but pulls everything together very quickly with cooking and cleaning and organizing the house so that things could be as well prepared and organized for the team and their family members. Simultaneously she tries to be a good mom for her daughter, going to as many recitals as possible, reminding her husband about recitals, and making up where he lacks 
 in communication with her daughter so she really seems to be doing several shifts of both being a mom, a confidant, a worker, and an organizer, and kind of the glue for the family when things start to fall apart for her husband after Jason gets injured."
SID000829,TimRiggins,"Tim Riggins has an unstsable family life in the show. He lives with his brother, it doesn't seem that there are any parents around and his brother is largely emotionally abusive or aggressive towards him this likely in some ways contributes to the fact that Tim drinks quite a lot for someone of his own age, often showing up to practice smelling of  
 alcohol and using it to cope with issues that are not revealed maybe in the first few episodes. Tim is close to Jason and suffers a lot, after Jason is injured, from guilt that he should have been able to protect Jason from getting tackled. This guilt leaves him unable to even visit Jason in the hospital and he just spends his weeks drinking and going to practice 
 and not even performing to the best of his ability because of his unmet feelings and needs in the situation he is shown really upset in one scene re-watching the play, crying, which just shows how much guilt he feels about the situation. Tim does go on to kiss Jason's girlfriend, Lyla, in a moment when they are both crying over what has happened. And I believe this will just cause more difficulties for him and  
 Jason's relationship as well as internalized feelings he has about himself once more of the information eventually does come out."
SID000829,TyraCollette,"In the first few episodes Tyra seems to have an unstable relationship with Tim, this grows more rocky as Jason is injured at Tim becomes more withdrawn, and Tyra hooks up with Smash, one of Tim's teammates. She does seem to care a lot about Tim and Jason, I think this is evidenced by the scene in which she drives after Tim
 who is drinking during the day and playing beer golf and she tries to convince him to see Jason and spend time with him. She also gives him the ultimatum that if he continues to not care and lets her walk away she will no longer be there for him. So she does seem to actually care about their relationship and being serious with each other but maybe is more guarded because of how withdrawn Tim is.   
 Tyra doesn't seem to have a relationship with Lyla or any of the other girls, it seems that a lot of girls are wary of her and distrusting and she kind of seems like a Lone Wolf during the first few episodes of the show who does care about everyone beneath the surface but for various reasons is unable to or too scared to show 
 how she actually feels."
SID000576,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy is kind of obsessed with this high school football team. He treats it like it's a professional team and kind of fails to realize that these kids are just high schoolers too. He's the father of a cheerleader for the team who, and the cheerleader also happens to be dating the team's quarterback. Buddy  
 seems like he's kind of ruthless and doesn't really have a strong moral compass. He will do pretty much anything to help the team win, even if that means breaking rules, stuff like that. He also kind of neglects his family in favor of this football team,
 which is interesting. He is the kind of guy who pokes fun at other people and thinks it's funny or or just kind of ... he tries to scare or not scare but he warneds  
 Coach Taylor about how if he loses again like he's not going to make it very long here, or he's going to lose his job or how how he's making bad calls you know that kind of thing, he's just a very critical guys. He doesn't play a huge role in the show but not my favorite character."
SID000576,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor seems like very much the stereotype of a manly man. He really cares about football, he's super super into it, he's super super into the game and the team. He seems like a pretty good coach but he is definitely has the coaching style where he definitely shows a lot of tough love on his team which maybe 
 is what he feels like you have to do for football. But he also is capable of having more emotional interactions with his team too. He obviously loves his wife and his family but sometimes gets distracted or a little bit too caught up in his job to be a good father 
 slash husband, not that he's like a bad father or husband, he just gets sidetracked by his job. It also seems like he cares a lot about both his job because he wants the team to do well, but also because he's worried about providing for his family he really needs the job in order to provide for his family 
 and he might get fired if the team keeps doing poorly. It also seems like he has pretty high morals and a strong sense of right and wrong. For example he's very unsure about kind of recruiting a player from New Orleans even though it's against league rules. Seems like all around a pretty good guy."
SID000576,JasonStreet,"Jason Street is the, was the star quarterback of the football team. He is very athletic, very popular guy, everybody seems to like him, seems like he's generally a pretty nice person. He gets hurt playing football and still shows that he cares about 
 the team and what like doesn't believe that the world revolves around him. He's obviously frustrated with his situation which sucks, but he also, it also seems like he has a lot of determination and will to get better. He also gets frustrated with the people around him who are just being 
 kind of falsely positive and optimistic all the time, which is also understandable. He seems generally like an all-around very good dude who was close with his coach I think he's close with his family. He is accepting of people who are different like Matt Saracen who  
 is his replacement for the time being. And a lot of people make fun of this kid, Matt, but but Jason believes in him. Jason is also friends with Tim who's kind of an angsty, rebellious guy and he accepts him for who he is so yeah."
SID000576,JulieTaylor,"Julie Taylor is Coach Taylor's daughter who he seems to be relatively protective of. She she does dance, she sometimes watches football games, but it seems like she loves her father but gets kind of exasperated with him for not, for paying too much attention to football and not really paying much a lot 
 attention to his family or her. Her dad kind of forgets about like her dance recital and stuff like that and I think that really hurts her cuz she just wants him to care about what she's doing too and not just football. Matt Saracen has a really big crush on Julie and I'm not sure if she knows that he likes her she might be getting the 
 idea that he does like her and I think she might like him back. ... She ... isn't super loud but seems like a smart, good person. Seems like she has a lot of spirit too.  
 Like she's like a pretty fun loving person. She dances, as I said, and seems to really like that. Yeah. She also is very helpful to her mom and very caring for her mom like when her mom is really stressed about this big party she's there to help her out and help relieve some stress."
SID000576,LandryClarke,"Let's see Bobby is Matt Saracen's best friend, he's not on the football team I don't believe, but he supports it. He's a pretty funny guy, a little bit dorky, doesn't seem to be very popular but is probably really smart. Hhe's there to support Matt as his friend 
 and is really excited for Matt which is nice to see. He seems like a very nice guy, doesn't play a super big role. He ... he's got a good sense of humor ... he
 and his friend Matt kind of banter back and forth a little bit. ... Yeah, seems like a good person, in general. He also is there for Matt as Matt tries to juggle a bunch of things like taking care of his grandma and football. He gives 
 Matt advice about what he thinks he should do. ... what else about him.... he likes girls and would like to have a girlfriend but most of the girls don't really talk to him."
SID000576,LylaGarrity,"Lyla is a very pretty girl who is kind of trying, it seems like she's trying to do it all and have it all. She's captain of the cheer team, she was dating Jason Street who was quarterback for the football team, she seems like very type A, very organized, very neat, she's super optimistic and super upbeat kind of excessively so like to her own detriment 
 where she's unwilling to recognize or accept that life isn't going to turn out the way she planned or that things have gone wrong. She has a really really big heart, she just obviously cares so so so much for those around her, especially her boyfriend Jason, and is doing everything that she can 
 to help him but seems like she might be a little bit out of touch with reality. She also kind of maybe possibly has feelings for another guy who happens to be her boyfriend's best friend and when she gets really stressed  
 or she's been under a lot of pressure with everything that's happening to her boyfriend and eventually ends up making out with his best friend kind of as a, it seems kind of like as a stress release maybe or just like something like that. So, but she doesn't want anybody to know about it."
SID000576,MattSaracen,"Matt Saracen seems like a very very very good guy. He's young, he's a sophomore, and he's been kind of thrust into this position of quarterback and there is a lot of pressure on him he's kind of receiving pressure from all angles both in football but also at home because his dad is in, his dad is overseas in the military and he is kind of 
 tasked with taking care of his grandma who has pretty bad dementia and needs to take a lot of pills and needs a lot of attention. But Matt just works so so so hard to help his grandma, and work a job, and play football, and get good at football and please his coach, and do well in school. He's smart and I think he gets his grades and take hard classes, He 
 isn't your, isn't like a lot of the guys on the football team in that he has other interests outside of football. They mentioned that he was into art and music. But he has kind of thrown himself into football and doesn't really have time to do those other things. He's kind of a social outcast to some extent, he isn't popular he's kind of shy, scared,  
 doesn't, isn't super talkative or anything like that and isn't super impulsive. I think he's easily not manipulated, but influenced, by those around him, like his teammates convinced him to go trash the rival teams car. He's also super loyal and will not rat any of his teammates out for anything..."
SID000576,SmashWilliams,"... So Smash is a very confident member of the team. He doesn't really get along with everybody very well and kind of starts to cause problems between team members by trying to take control and kind of assigned  
 himself the role of captain. He seems like a good speaker like, and good at typing the team up but he doesn't, he doesn't seem like he's good at listening to other people. He is the one he has a he has a big party that a lot of people go to. He  
 is the one who wants to go trash the rival teams car... He is not very kind to a lot of people ... or he could be kinder to Matt Saracen and Tim. Tim and Smash 
 have a lot of tension between them because I think Tim sees, thinks that Smash is trying to replace Jason and kind of take advantage of this of Jason's injury to to elevate himself ,,, which kind of does seem like what he's doing to be honest."
SID000576,TamiTaylor,"Tami Taylor is the wife of the head football coach. She works as a guidance counselor at the same school and she has a daughter who's also in high school. She seems like a pretty down-to-earth practical lady and she's trying to support her husband as he does his job as head coach, but he's not always super supportive of her and what she does and that 
 frustrates her, understandably. So, I think she kind of, she puts up with a lot but she's also willing to bring up bring it up to her husband when something upsets her, so there's that. She seems like a very hard worker and very loving and open but she's not as football crazy as everybody else 
 in the town seems to be. She ... is very compassionate and also it seems like pretty passionate about her job as a guidance counselor. She really wants to make sure that the kids are doing well and even if that means not being obsessed with football. She ... 
 everybody in the show is very I don't know seems to adhere to the southern stereotype, maybe it's just the accent I don't know. She's ... Tammy Taylor is ... organized but not too organized, yeah."
SID000576,TimRiggins,"Tim Riggins is kind of the angsty rebel of the football team. He is best friends with the quarterback and they kind of balance each other out in a way I think. He kind of has, he comes off like a like an angsty bad boy, but and he is super stoic and doesn't want to show emotion, 
 super man's man excetera excetera, but I think he has a softer side underneath and actually feel emotion really really deeply, but doesn't really know how to express it and is super uncomfortable expressing it. I think that he ... well in the show he blames himself for his best friend, the quarterback of a football team, 
 getting hurt and really beats himself up about it, but doesn't talk to anybody about it. He's kind of quiet he's not very commicative and really like kind of like a macho manly man in some ways. He's also very mysterious, probably because he doesn't talk a lot and so you don't really know what's going on with him. He falls in love  
 with his best friend's girlfriend. He gets kind of impulsive because he's willing to act on his feelings for this girl even though she's dating someone else maybe that goes along with the bad boy thing ... yeah. ... He also doesn't look,  he looks kind of grungy,"
SID000576,TyraCollette,"Alright so Tyra is a very pretty girl who is dating kind of the school or the football teams rebel, but they end up breaking up because she doesn't like what he's doing and I think that really shows that she isn't going to take, she's isn't going to take any BS from anyone. She is kind of promiscuous,
 she also seems like she has a very caring heart. She goes to visit this guy who gets hurt playing football and she, she really tells him how sorry she is for him but also she isn't pitying him which is different from the how the rest of the characters treat him. She's very much a realist, she's not gonna
 tell you something that's fake, like she'll give give you give it to you straight. She seems like she has a little bit of a temper like she likes to get things her way, but she stands up for herself and she stands up for what she wants. She's just seems like a very 
 confident woman, young woman, high schooler. She really doesn't seem like a high schooler, she seems much older than a high schooler, at least that's the impression that I got. Other than that, yeah, she doesn't come off as studious but she does seem smart."
SID000836,BuddyGarrity,"Okay I really don't like this guy and he's really annoying. He really the only thing he cares about, and it seems like he doesn't even care about his daughter, is winning football games and I really would like to know why he cares so much about this football team maybe it was said, but I don't remember because he's just annoying. First off the conversation he had with his wife when Lyla was listening to him about
 Jason and how she'll get bored and leave him, was just totally awful and I don't think I've seen him have one interaction with his daughter in all of the episodes we've watched maybe he had a couple but nothing charismatic or like he seemed to care about her at all or his wife actually. But I can tell you one thing, he does care about football cuz he goes out of his way to make sure the coach goes to meet Voodoo at
 X-place and make sure that Voodoo gets on the team because we got to win football games, that's the most important thing football is number one always, no matter what. And he's really moved on from the fact that Jason is hurt. I don't remember him talking about him at all after, yeah a couple episodes he just doesn't care, moved on, Jason's gone and we got to win football games and
 I feel like that's his mentality always. And I don't know if he really likes the coach. I'm still trying to decide that, but as long as the coach does what he wants he likes them. If not, well then by but I guess that's his personality with everyone it seems so..."
SID000836,CoachTaylor,"Okay so Coach is really the main character of the show and he's actually got a lot going on. Not only does he have to deal with his like family stuff and being the coach of a football team, he also has to deal with like the pressure of all these white men whose only objective or goal is for the team to get to State or Nationals or whatever and win all the time, they don't care about the players, they don't care about 
 anything they just want the team to win. Which is why I think that coach has such a hard time dealing with them and working with them he kind of doesn't want to put up with their BS he just wants the best for his players and you know he wants to win too but he just has a different way of doing it. He seems to really care about Saracen which I think is really cool. He's really pushing him to get his best potential cuz he seems to know that the kid can do it just the kid has to find 
 in himself and work towards the same goal. Yeah he really cares about his players and he's a real hard ass, he does not care about anyone else's opinion it seems and he just does what he thinks is right and he seems to be a real mentor to his team even though sometimes they hate his guts and he seems to be really good husband and a good dad to his daughter and I don't know he just has a lot going on 
 all the time. ... Oh also he he just seems unafraid, basically I mean he's kind of afraid of losing but unafraid to like face people or voice his opinions or whatever."
SID000836,JasonStreet,"Okay so Jason started out as this untouchable-seeming star quarterback for his team, irreplaceable, and then he got seriously injured in the first game we saw in the season and he became paralyzed basically from his shoulders down but as of right now they say he's going to regain ability to move his arms and his hands but not his legs. 
 He has a girlfriend, Lyla, and two parents seem to be really supportive, but he seems to be really stressed, he did yell at his girlfriend and basically tell her that nothing is going to get better and he seems really down. Your kind of conditioned to feel really bad for him because all these terrible things are happening to him and nothing good has really happened to him yet I mean his girlfriend's cheating on him, he's paralyzed, he went from the hospital to the rehab
 facility and he really doesn't seem to like the rehab facility but we did see a glimmer of hope there when he and his roommate irritated him and he kind of knocked the soda up towards him so hopefully that's a sign that he'll get his mobility back maybe even in his life sometime but he still wears a neck brace and he's just very immobile at this point so how could you be happy when basically all that you've known is taken
 away from you but he's super supportive of his team which is really cool actually because I feel like if you get paralyzed and you, everything is ripped away from you, it takes a lot to be so supportive of what you knew and has been ripped away from you so he's annoying sometimes but he's cool."
SID000836,JulieTaylor,"Okay so Julie is the coach's daughter you know remember the one Saracen has a really big crush on, the one that or yeah Saracen has a big crush on her. I really like her she seems really down-to-earth and reserved and to herself even though she's always doing the right thing, always helping her parents, doing her work and she seems really really sweet and actually I think she likes  
 Saracen too, I think they're going to end up together, but I think ... she's a great character to have on the show. She kind of centers the mom and the dad and reminds coach that you know he has his own life outside of football even though he often forgets that. So yeah also once Coach told
 Saracen to get her in the back of a car in order to forget about her which is quite funny cuz he didn't know he was talking about his daughter when he was telling him to get his crush out of his head. So yeah, I think her character is going to develop I don't think she's fully there yet."
SID000836,LandryClarke,"Okay so Landry's, I classify him as the airhead of the group. He seems like he thinks, I don't know, he seems like he thinks he knows what he's doing but when he's giving advice to who I think is his best friend, the quarterback who replaced the quarterback who broke his back, he just seems very lost in his own thoughts and confused. 
 But yeah, I feel like he's also pretty irrelevant to the main plot of the story I mean he's part of the team but I don't see how his character plays a huge role in the main plot of the story."
SID000836,LylaGarrity,"Okay so at first I really didn't mind Lyla, but now she really annoys me okay, anyway, let's start from the beginning. She started off, she's a cheerleader and whatever and she's the star quarterback girlfriend so she's got a pretty nice life and once her boyfriend becomes, you know, paralyzed in the hospital her life really turns upside down which is understandable but she was really supportive of him, 
 she spent her birthday in the hospital with him and she even took flack from him and she seems to really love him until she ends up cheating on him with Tim who is literally just awful, but I guess you could say it's because she's emotionally distressed and doesn't know what she wants for the rest of her life and basically has these false hopes and beliefs that Jason is just going to get better and everything is going  
 to be the way that it was and it really probably isn't, so maybe she's coming to that realization, but the first time she kissed him I was like okay like fine but the second time I just feel like there's really no excuse and now not only is she hurting Jason she's also hurting herself and Tim so, I don't know what's going to happen and at first I could I felt like I could defend why 
 she was cheating on Jason but now I'm just kind of disappointed. But I don't want to take away from the fact that her situation is pretty awful and stressful so ... and the fact that she overheard her parents say that she needs to like basically throw Jason out is like pretty awful too."
SID000836,MattSaracen,"Okay so Matt has a lot going on. Okay not only did he have to replace the football team Star Quarterback his dad is also in Afghanistan and his grandma has some sort of dementia maybe Alzheimers, I don't know they haven't really said the details yet and he lives alone with her so not only does he have to take care of her he has to deal with the pressure of being the star football player and replacing the old star football player and he doesn't seem 
 to be able to focus. One because he has a huge crush on the coach's daughter which is great and 2 because he has to worry about his grandma who is now leaving the house and roaming around the neighborhood taking baths in other people's houses. He's under a lot of pressure to be the best quarterback especially since they've recently recruited a new quarterback and I like his character. 
 His character's a pretty nice guy ... yeah ... I guess that's it.... Oh he's been doing a really good job staying loyal to his team I didn't expect him to beat up or get beat up and not say names but he did and it seems like he's really gaining a reputation with the team and with the coach so that's good. 
 What else can I say about him... I feel bad for him I feel like everyone expects him to fail except for the coach but it must be hard it's a lot of pressure and he doesn't have parents around."
SID000836,SmashWilliams,"Okay so Smash is one of the guys on the football team he is actually I think pretty irrelevant to the plot except for the fact that he likes to talk trash about the coach on National Television. He also recruits all the team members to go and smash the car of their rival team after they vandalized their locker room. Yeah... he's a pretty interesting  
 character I guess, but I'm not sure where his character will go from here through the rest of the show so ... oh and I guess should say I think he's pretty annoying."
SID000836,TamiTaylor,"Great so Tami is the coach's wife and at first I kind of labeled her as like just the coach's wife, but then she gets a job as the counselor at the school and she really starts to hold her own. She starts to like tell him that he needs to be more compassionate with the players and she's actually a really really good wife and mom I mean she hosts this party for a hundred people with two days notice. She seems to really be playing a  
 part in the show, I mean she's helping out the quarterback who came back or the quarterback without the broken back and she's also seems to be juggling a thousand things at once she's managing her husband's life, her life, and also reminding her husband about her daughter's life and what's going on in her life. Yeah I really like her ...
 She's like a pillar of strength for Coach it seems. He really cares about her and  
 he really cares about her and she really cares about him and they just seem to have a good relationship going, which is encouraging. ..."
SID000836,TimRiggins,"Okay so at first I felt bad for Tim, but like now I don't really feel bad because I guess at the beginning he kind of blamed himself for the injury of his best friend and he was kind of drinking his sorrows away and he was super depressed and all that stuff, but now he's really blowing it out of proportion because he's making out with Lyla who is actually his best friend's girlfriend and the only person who's really 
 consistently visiting his best friend in the hospital and he's telling her that he's in love with her when she clearly is trying to break it off so she doesn't hurt his best friend and her boyfriend oh my gosh, so complicated. I also feel bad for him no longer because he's choosing to drink, he's choosing to kiss this girl who he's really not supposed to be, and he's hurting his best friend  
 continuously and he still hasn't gone to visit him in the hospital. And I just don't like him. ... he's annoying. ..."
SID000836,TyraCollette,"Okay I don't really have a lot to say about Tyra cuz I feel like we didn't learn much about her, but she is being a really good friend to I don't know his name, the quarterback who got hurt and encouraging her now ex-boyfriend to go see him even though he's a growing alcoholic who doesn't care and I guess we should feel bad for him because he blames himself for the injury of his best friend but he neglects to go see him in the hospital
 and so the fact that she's encouraging him to go see him and is recognizing that what he's doing is pretty horrible I guess encourages me or pretty much makes me like her a bit more. She also goes to visit the quarterback who's hurt in the hospital which I thought was pretty cool because she acknowledges that she doesn't really talk to him and she knows that they're not really friends, 
 but she goes to see him anyway and apologizes for her boyfriend which is totally unnecessary but I guess it's a sign of good character. Yeah, but I feel like she's going to end up back with him sooner or later even though he's in love with Lyla, whatever. ..."
SID000839,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy is Lyla's father. He is really invested in the football team and once played on the the town's team when he was younger. He is probably 45 or 50, he owns the car dealership and so he's pretty well off in the town, but even though there is a mayor of a town he kind of almost like makes himself 
 the pretend mayor and does whatever he wants but football is also his life and he seems to not really pay attention to the issues going on in Lyla's life but more just on the football team and what they need and stuff like that. ..."
SID000839,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor is the town's football team's coach. Football and the team is his life to a point where he is never happy. He does not seem like a great father or  great husband; all he cares about and spends his time doing is football related. He seems like he neglects his daughter and wife and doesn't 
 appreciate them. He's really hard on the team and but also wants the boys to be good people in a sense, so he definitely pushes them, but he's also feeling a lot of pressure from the town people because everyone is obsessed with football and he has to win or else he has to move. He has dark hair and  
 is an attractive man and ladies in the town think he's attractive to, but he's so focused on football and then his family that that doesn't matter. ... He seems like a good coach, dedicated, he's not afraid to do what he wants, which is good. He doesn't 
 necessarily listen to the townspeople or the assistant coaches so he's definitely in charge. ..."
SID000839,JasonStreet,"Jason Street was the star quarterback and basically like an All-American boy and kind of like the dream like a dream combination. He was very put together but also very humble about his football abilities and and he was almost like a god in the town and everything in his life like seems like perfect with Lyla and football and Notre Dame
 and then after the accident everything kind of like fell apart and he's having trouble coming like to terms with his accident and also like with his relationship with Lyla, but he comes from like a stable family like a nice put together family and that also has been really hard on them. But, he is 
 he has a good build and is muscular and has brown hair and like people rave about him, or they like rave about his football like even like around the country but he was really humble and I think now he's just kind of not really sure where to go because like his whole life has been football and now he kind of has nothing, yeah. ..."
SID000839,JulieTaylor,"... Sorry, Julie is the daughter of Coach Taylor abd
 she's awesome but also very quiet and kind of does her own thing and she's like reserved from the football players because of who her dad is. And she dances and has blonde hair and is pretty and she is like always reading, she's yeah, 
 she seems smart and driven and she's a little sassy and like funny to her parents and to other people and she still supports the football team and goes to their games but for her football is not necessarily her life except for the fact that her dad is the coach but other than that she, she like definitely does her own thing and is a cool girl. ..."
SID000839,LandryClarke,"Landry is a really nice and funny guy. He's best friends with Matt and the two of them are a little duo. Landry is always pushing Matt to do scarier things and like take risks and he kind of lives like vicariously with the whole sports thing through Matt. But, 
 he's really funny ...yeah. ... He has red hair ... He ... he has a 
 car. He's definitely funny, does his own thing too. ... Matt's grandma doesn't really like him. ..."
SID000839,LylaGarrity,"Lyla is supposed to be perfect, basically, and she comes off very innocent and naive kind of about the world, but she's like very popular and very pretty and dates or dated like the star quarterback in her mind and everything was perfect.
 She's a cheerleader and so she's very peppy and her home situation her dad is like a popular man in the town and has a car dealership and so they're pretty well off and it basically everything about her life is supposed to be perfect like her home, her boyfriend, school. And she tries to 
 keep it that way even after her boyfriend's accident, but things totally change after that. She has brown hair and is a little, she's tan. I haven't seen her often with girls so I don't know if she actually has friends besides her boyfriend, but ...
 she seems caring about Jason her boyfriend but just seems most invested in that and not as much other things. ..."
SID000839,MattSaracen,"Matt is a really good person, so sweet and so cute. He's really sweet with his grandma and he has to take care of his grandma who has like Alzheimer's or dementia or something and they never discuss what happened to his mom but his dad is deployed and so he kind of is the man of the house 
 and has to worry about the stress of school and football and taking care of his grandma. But he's just such a sweet quiet guy, still likes to have fun he's just really quiet to begin with. And he is now playing quarterback, which he's doing okay 
 but he feels that no one really like wants him to be the quarterback or believes in him which is a kind of true but he needs to work harder and he needs to and he has a crush on the coach's daughter and the crush is really cute. ... and ...  
 He is like a normal height and has like dirty blonde like short hair, not dirty blonde, I'd say brown hair. ... yeah. ..."
SID000839,SmashWilliams,"... Smash is a football player. He's really talented but also very very arrogant and cocky. He is cocky about pretty much everything, but especially football and girls and now that Jason is injured he's kind of made
 himself the captain. He is black and lives in like a poor part of the town with his siblings and he lives like, he has a mom at least, but for like their family and for him like football is his life and that's kind of his ticket out and cuz he has like hope to go to the NFL, 
 but overall he's like really not friendly to people and him and, what's his nam, Tim Riggins, don't get along. But also I bet deep down he's a good person as well, it just it's just different you know. ... 
 And so far he hasn't really gotten along with Coach Taylor just because Smash doesn't really like to listen to anyone or like just thinks he's so good that he doesn't need it. ..."
SID000839,TamiTaylor,"Tami is awesome. She is Coach Taylor's wife and Julie's mom and she is really funny, she's really pretty and like hot, she is like tan and has dirty blonde hair and she kind of, she puts up with her husband's like obsessiveness with football 
 so she's definitely a really good wife. She is now a counselor at the school, so she's like easy going and like talkative and likes helping people. She's like funny, and witty. She also has to put up with like everyone's like questions from the town like of either like inviting her to like book clubs or 
 just like who they think her husband's gonna play. So she definitely puts up with all the football talk, it seems like a really hard situation so she's really patient ... as a wife. ..."
SID000839,TimRiggins,"Tim Riggins is a football player. He's very talented, but does not put a lot of effort into the anything. He always appears like he doesn't care about anything or is not interested in basically being a good person or nice. However he seems,  
 there seems to be something deeper that like something is bothering him, but for the most part he just does his own thing and doesn't really seem to care about much. He lives with his older brother and and they kind of grew up in not necessarily a great home situation and he drinks a lot. He's very attractive and definitely is 
 interested in girls ... but again he doesn't seem very interested in a lot of things just kind of pissing people off and doing whatever he wants ... he has
 long brown black hair in like a jaw, a squared jaw almost and has a good build and he's in love with Lyla Garrity and his best friend is the boy who got injured."
SID000839,TyraCollette,"Tyra is very attractive, but she also knows that and uses that. It seems like her priority is boys. She seemed like she dated Tim Riggins for a little bit but also seems like she may have not becasue she is with other people. She seems kind of like she
 enjoys causing trouble and drama. But she has blonde hair and is tan and is definitely like a hot person persay, but she she seems like a little more trashier like is kind of like the exact opposite of Lyla 
 and I feel like she has insecurities inside that kind of make her be mean, but that like deep down she is a good person and wants to be a good person but it's just hard for her to get there right now. ..."
SID000841,BuddyGarrity,"So I'm not totally sure like a lot about Buddy's character. I know he's Lyla's dad and it seems like he works at like a car dealership her owns it or something like that and for some reason that's connected to Coach Taylor like I think they either used to work together there or something like that. And I don't totally understand why, but it seems like he has like a lot of 
 say in who's on the team and how the team runs so when the other like recruit from New Orleans comes in, he is the one that like goes over there and tells him to come and play for the team and ends up like getting him on the field and just being like okay you're on the team now and I don't know really know like why he
 is able to do that and why he has so much say in how it runs. Maybe he likes donates a lot of money or something to the team, I don't know. He sort of just like pops up at random times and like random places. You know, he's always like at the game ? sort of there a lot at the practices and like behind the scenes as well so. ..."
SID000841,CoachTaylor,"So Coach Taylor is like sort of a character I don't really like it all. He seems like extremely self-absorbed and like way to focused on football at the expense of things that probably should be a little bit more important like his family. You know, so like when his wife Tammy wants to get a job and then ends up being the guidance counselor, he's like upset with her because she's working at the same school which he doesn't 
 own the school, like he's just a football coach but in his mind this seems to be the most important thing in the whole place and then sort of like, undermines what she does and pretends like it's not real work. And then throws this party and gives her like a day or two notice and doesn't even tell her how many people are going to be there so she's totally caught off guard and unprepared even though she's like working really hard to get everything done in time. And then when she's mad because like a bunch of guys are like basically destroying her house
 and you know, she has to work so hard and she's like cleaning up and he's like you needed to stop being mad and you need to come out there and like get over it which is like not okay. And then, you know. he totally forgets about his daughter's dance recital which was really important to her and important for her to have him there. So it just seems like overall he really only cares about himself and football and everybody else is suffering for it and at the end 
 he starts to like get better as far as really caring about the kids and trying to like coach them and make them better and that's like sort of her doing but again it still plays into the whole like him and football are the most important things mindset that he has going on."
SID000841,JasonStreet,"So Jason was the quarterback of the football team at first and you only really hear him talk a lot like at the beginning of the show before his accident. I guess he is pretty much like the star of team and like town hero and everyone loved him and he seemed pretty humble about it and then during that game, the first game of the show he got hit really badly and  
 ended up like having a spinal injury so the rest of the show he was just paralyzed in the hospital like in a hospital bed. I guess his legs are paralyzed in his arms are mostly paralyzed. And he still has been pretty positive and mature about it the whole time like he just wanted to know like what the likelihood of him walking again was and when the coach came and talked to him about Matt, he said he wasn't
 sure about him, Jason said that he should give him a chance and Matt will surprise him and stuff. He wanted to keep watching the games even though he wasn't able to play anymore so seems like he was taking it pretty well. And was still like happy to see his girlfriend and he did like snap at her once because she kept saying that he definitely would walk again and he sort of has like come to the conclusion that 
 he's not going to walk ever again. And then he gets a new roommate and the roommate's like, keeps kind of testing him, who's also in a wheelchair and it seems like he's sort of coming like to the realization that it might start dying off, that everyone's still visiting him and loving him but it will eventually quiet down and people will go away."
SID000841,JulieTaylor,"So Julie is the daughter of Coach Taylor and his wife Tammy Taylor. She has like long blonde hair with bangs and freckles and I guess like presumably she goes to the same high school that they both work. And it doesn't I guess really ever say like what grade she's in and I like how old she is but for some reason I like feel like she's a little bit younger 
 than all of the other characters. And she seems pretty smart like when she was at the restaurant she was reading Moby Dick and I never like really see her with any friends though, she's always just sort of by herself or with her parents and seems to have a really good relationship with her parents. Like when her mom was setting up for the party she was helping all the time and like running back to the store and setting everything up instead of like 
 just enjoying the party. And she said to Landry at the beginning that she was like not interested in talking to any football players, I think that's just like a rule she made for herself or whatever. And then she also does dance and she had a dance recital that she wanted her parents to be at and was really happy when they were there like a hip hop dance or something. 
 ... Yeah otherwise she just seems like pretty quiet in general and like to herself and really sweet. ..."
SID000841,LandryClarke,"So Landry is like probably Matt's best friend but he kinda seems like this weird side character that we don't really know anything about, like they don't really go into what he does cuz he's not on the football team, or like what his interests are, what his situation is or anything. We only really see him when he's just hanging out with Matt and he's always 
 there like helping him practice throwing the football, or getting food with him, or whatever. So he's just sort of like his sidekick in a way and then towards the beginning he looked like he also had kind of a crush on Julie, but then said she didn't want to talk to him and that was sort of the end of it. But yeah, I mean he seems really nice and he's he's like a little bit more loud than Matt 
 and is sort of just like always talking to him and trying to like get him to be a little more outgoing but overall we don't really know that much about him. ..."
SID000841,LylaGarrity,"Okay so Lyla is Jason Street's girlfriend and she's a cheerleader for the football team. She's really pretty, has long brown hair and big eyes and like a pretty strong southern accent. She seems really sweet especially like when Jason gets in his accident she goes to the hospital pretty much every day and spends her birthday having dinner with him and is really positive about 
 his recovery but sort of doesn't seem like she reads the situations that well and isn't good at just like empathizing with him and just like allowing him time to be upset about what happened and always just saying like he's going to get better which kind of makes it seem like she doesn't want to believe that it happened herself because she's like planning on getting 
 to him and her parents also like think she's sort of living in a fantasy, that she'll just get bored and get over it pretty soon and she overhears that so it seems like she's trying to prove them wrong in a way. And then she also starts like having a relationship with Jason's friend Tim in the last two episodes
 and seems like she feels pretty guilty about it. But yeah. ..."
SID000841,MattSaracen,"So Matt is the, I guess like standby for the football team and then takes over as quarterback when Jason gets injured and he seems like at the beginning he, he likes football but like wasn't that invested in it and sort of never thought that he would actually be playing and he's like a pretty quiet person in general it seems like he has like a pretty bad situation. 
 I don't remember them mentioning what happened to his mom, but like his dad is away at war and he has to, he's staying with his grandma but she has dementia so he's pretty much just taking care of her and has to like make sure she takes her pills and makes her food and when she disappears he has to go and find her and get her back home and everything and he's the only person to do it so he has a lot of responsibility with school that. And then when he actually gets on the team it seems like it's pretty
 overwhelming for him and unexpected and he messes up quite a bit in the beginning but then seems to make a pretty good comeback and kind of gets caught up in like the teams hype when he goes and destroys that person's car then ends up getting beat up for it. He also works at like a restaurant or something which makes it seem like he's probably  
 providing a lot of the income for him and his grandma and he also seems like he has a crush on the coach's daughter Julie but doesn't really know how to pursue it. ..."
SID000841,SmashWilliams,"So Smash is just like the super loud jock of the team. And he's always you know saying something and like being really present, seems like he loves all the attention that he gets from being a football player from just their community and from all the girls or anything that he can get. Which at first was like hard for me to adjust to because I've seen the same actor play the character Ross in Grey's Anatomy who's like  
 super timid and loving, so seeing the same person in a different setting was like hard to realize it's a different character. But, he always seems to be the person who's like causing a lot of trouble, like when Jason can't play anymore he like takes over his booth and is sort of shouting his mouth off about how he's like the new lead of a team and he'll just have to take over. When they're at practice  
 he seems to be mouthing off to the coach a lot and he doesn't agree with Matt being on the team and ends up like having them do a lot more practices. Just like there's always him, I guess he also, I think he was part of the car smashing thing, he wanted to like lead up some revenge movement when they destroyed the locker room so he's always just like there 
 and like being really angry about everything and loud about everything. But then when they have to do that like overnight practice in the rain he sort of led them in chanting and like boosting their team morale which is really good too because it's sort of brought everybody together so seems like he's really passionate about it and just like puts up a cold front to get more attention."
SID000841,TamiTaylor,"So Tami is Coach Taylor's wife and Julie's mom and she's like actually a pretty cool character cuz I think she has to deal with a lot of the crap from her husband but still stands up for herself cuz she knows like what she does is important too. So like when you know he just has her throw this massive 
 party like on a whim, she does it but you know is angry about it and like lets him know that, which is good cuz she should be and when he's like ragging on her job she stands up for herself and says like what I do is important and it's hard and you wouldn't be able to do it, I'm sure. And then she seems like really supportive of her daughter and still really supportive of him even though like he's not the best 
 to her, she's always at his games and like when he's just being a potato on the couch and like watching football she still like you know she says goodbye to him and gives him a kiss goodbye and stuff and is really sweet to him. It seems like she prefers to be sort of on her own and doesn't really enjoy getting involved in all the stuff, like the other women in the town have like their book club meeting and invite her and she's not really
 interested in going but ends up going anyways and like said she got herself involved in a bunch of committees and they all want her to like make rice crispy treats and participate in stuff and she's sort of just like, I guess. So yeah I think she'd prefer to just be on her own and like with her family but sort of gets roped into all these things."
SID000841,TimRiggins,"So Tim is like sort of a stereotypical bad boy character has like the long hair and always looks really angry and whatever. And he seems like he's sort of like an alcoholic or has some like not great family life. I don't know exactly who he lives with because it seems sort of like a father figure but like the guy doesn't look old enough to be his dad so maybe it's an older brother or some other 
 family member which just shows like you know, clearly he doesn't have like a mom around and I don't think he has a dad around so for whatever situation he's in he's probably had sort of a tough childhood and like when he's being interviewed he said he just likes to be aggressive, he doesn't care about injuring the other football players he just like enjoys like being aggressive out there and 
 whatever. But it seems like he also has a pretty soft inside like there's a part of the show where he's clearly blamed himself for Jason's injuries since that is his best friend, even though it's like really not his fault and there's nothing he could have done to help and he's just watching the clip of it over and over and like starts crying and he doesn't go visit Jason and it seems like he just like can't really bring himself to do it, like it's too hard for him cuz
 he really thinks it's his fault. And then after his like, he ends up making out with Lyla. He clearly has feelings for her and you can see him just like looking at her and wanting to see her all the time and clearly putting in a lot of effort to impress her so it seems like he has a really tough exterior but pretty soft on the inside."
SID000841,TyraCollette,"So Tyra seems like another one of those characters that's just sort of like a side person, so we don't know a lot about like her home life or anything else it's just like she's around football players a lot and she's really pretty, I guess she's supposed to be like the hot girl character. And she's dating Tim Riggins at first, 
 but she still like super flirty with everybody else like there's a party or whatever and she's sort of all over Jason Street before their first big game and Lyla like sees it and gets upset and Jason said that she just sort of came up to him and didn't, and then her and Tim start flirting quite a bit and then it looks like she goes and cheats on him with Smash 
 and I think Tim finds out at some point and is also just like kind of over her. She seems like she wants to cause a lot of drama and stuff. So there's a scene where they end up breaking up and she kind of challenges him and says like if I get in this car, you'll never see me again, but he really doesn't seem to care at all. So she seems kind of upset about that and then we don't really see her very much after that. So yeah, she's sort of 
 just like there in relation to mostly Tim, but also just like the football team in general. And then at one point she also goes to visit Jason in the hospital and tells him that she's really sorry about what happened and sorry that Tim hasn't come to visit yet, so that sort of showed a nicer side of her."
SID000857,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy is owner of the car dealership of Dylan and the main booster for the football team. He's slimy, pigheaded, impatient. He'll do anything he can for the sake of the team, but at the expense of actually listening to anyone else's opinion besides his own. 
 Definitely an idiot, short-sighted, ... also some really questionable ethics. ..."
SID000857,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor is the new head coach of Dillon's football team. He is hard-working, dedicated to the team and his family, intelligent, not always as passionate as he should be but he also seems aware of his limits. 
 ... He is like confident but not egotistical. ...
 Seems like a true leader and some real ? . ..."
SID000857,JasonStreet,"Jason Street was the number one quarterback for Dillon's football team until an accident in a game in the first episode left him paralyzed from the waist down. Don't feel like I have a good grasp on him as a character from what episodes I've watched. He obviously loves football above all else, 
 but this accident has really shaken him and he seems to have gotten pretty hopeless but ? also see he still has inner strength and that's waiting to come out. ..."
SID000857,JulieTaylor,"She's the daughter of Coach and Tami, she's a dancer, she loves her parents, seems to be a little full of herself. And not as nice to others necessarily as she could be. ...
 ... just seems like your average teenage girl ... not particularly memorable ..."
SID000857,LandryClarke,"Landry is Saracen's best friend. He's not athletic, he's goofy, a little nerdy, shy around women. ... Definitely a good friend to Saracen.  ..."
SID000857,LylaGarrity,"Lyla Garrity is a cheerleader and Jason Street's girlfiend. She for the most part is dedicated to Street. She's overly idealistic, to the point that I would say she's naive. She's definitely a goody two shoes. Seems like she might have a bit of  
 wilder side to her, judging by her infidelities with tim. Comes across as rather idiotic... and irritating."
SID000857,MattSaracen,"After Stree's accident, Saracen becomes the number one string quarterback in football team. Saracen is shy, humble, a bit of an intellectual, he's very loving and supportive and his family, specifically his grandmother and also his father's in Iraq. He lacks self-esteem definitely needs some 
 propping up from his coach, but at the same time that he definitely has some real strength and talent inside of him. ..."
SID000857,SmashWilliams,"Smash is one of the start players on the football team. He is utterly full of himself and he's flirtatious, headstrong, very athletic. Definitely has some loose ethical boundaries, considering he slept with someone who he knew had a boyfriend. 
 ... really immature, not particularly nice or supportive of his family. Shows no loyalty to his football coach either. Has a long-standing rivalry with Tim. ..."
SID000857,TamiTaylor,"Tami is the wife of Coach Taylor. She's the new guidance counselor at the high school and also a mother. She is very kind, loving, and supportive, especially of her husband and daughter. There's a good sense of humor to her ...
 and she also definitely has some backbone, isn't afraid to stand up for herself for stand up for others, what she thinks is right. She's sociable. ..."
SID000857,TimRiggins,"Tim is a bit of a bad boy, he's an alcoholic. He likes to be this tough guy image, always like to present to the world but he also clearly has some underlying depth to him. ... 
 He's very, he feels really guilty over what happened to his best friend Jason Street and that's something that really haunts him. ..."
SID000857,TyraCollette,"Tyra comes across as rather slutty, especially because she cheated on her boyfriend Tim with Smash. She definitely has some fire to her ... She's pretty independent.  
 Somewhat mean, stubborn. That being said she also has like a warmer side to her. And yeah she doesn't really show as much but she defnitely cares about people. ..."
SID000860,BuddyGarrity,"buddy is Lyla's father he sounds to be a big fanatic of football he seems a bit arrogant and he seems to think that he knows it all he's sometimes critical of Coach Taylor he sounds  to be a classic father 
 he's not very supportive of Lyla and continuing to have faith in her relationship with Jason he thinks that she should start to think about moving on...(long pause) he's very invested in the football"
SID000860,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor is a very dedicated coach to the football team he sometimes sacrifices time with his own family and his own sleep to improve the performance of his team sometimes it seems like he wants the team to do well for his own selfish reasons he's worried about his reputation and the status of football in the town that they live it makes him very motivated  
 to do a good job so that people see him in a good light he's sometimes very arrogant and aggressive but he means well he wants to be proud of his work and of his team he wants his family to be proud of him and he goes to great lengths to try to achieve that sometimes he fails and
 he has a hard time forgiving himself and he takes his anger out on his team but ultimately that's one of the things that could be making him a good coach...(long pause)... Coach Taylor loves his family and his wife 
 he tries to spend as much time with them as possible and he tries to balance his commitments"
SID000860,JasonStreet,"Jason is one of the football players on the team he got the paralyzed after being tackled on the field really hard in the hospital his family learned said he will most likely never be able to use his legs again if I was boyfriend he is very valued by the team the coach offers to save a spot for him for if he ever gets better at the size 3 
 Fatima Grieves his loss from playing football he still insist on watching his team play football on TV even though he can't participate in the game being in the hospital bothers him a lot because he's he's used to being independent 
 and being hospitalized makes me weak and dependent on others irritated by his situation and he isn't very optimistic he starts to lose faith in his relationship and he becomes irritated as his girlfriend because she's not realistic about the outlook 
 he is also not very motivated to recover from his injuries because he resists treatment at the rehab place"
SID000860,JulieTaylor,"Julie is coach Taylor's daughter she shown us up very curly girl she dances she sometimes has a short temper with her parents your expectations are very high for parents and she gets upset very easily she sought after by some of the players on the football team 
 but at the same time the players are cautious because they don't want to get on the Coach's bad side...(long pause)...she sometimes leads the players on at the same time she's very helpful to her parents and understanding of her parents careers and choices 
 she's independent confident"
SID000860,LandryClarke,"Landry is Matt's best friend he seems to cling to Matt and depend on him for a lot. Matt seems to be his only friend. Landry is not on the football team and he doesn't seem like he's very good at football. Landry seems a little antisocial. Matt's grandmother disapproves of him...(pause)
 He seems desperate for a relationship. He has blonde hair. His family is not shown very much. He seems lonely 
 and depressed"
SID000860,LylaGarrity,"Lyla is Jason's girlfriend. She's very devastated when Jason is paralyzed and can't move his legs but she seems to love her very much she seems to love him very much and she visits him in the hospital everyday even though her parents tell her that it might not be a good idea and she should move on. At first she remains very faithful to Jason and this is based on the hope that his legs
 will recover. Once she learns that it's very unlikely that his legs will recover she starts to lose faith in him and she starts cheating on him with his best friend. She prays a lot hoping that this will solve the problem of her boyfriend being paralyzed however she is 
 unrealistic because she does not want to accept the reality that the life that she planned might not happen. She's a cheerleader on the high school football team. She seems very popular and very sought-after by the male football players on the team. 
 She has brown long hair."
SID000860,MattSaracen,"Matt is one of the main characters of the show. he's a football player he starts off being not very good at football and he gots insulted a lot by his teammates and by his coach his dad is in  Iraq he lives alone with his grandmother who has dementia and he has to take care of her he's depicted as very stressed out during the show he has
 a lot going on in his life he's very kind polite and gentle he has a best friend who he spends a lot of time with he has short blonde hair...(long pause)
 at times he can be a little aggressive and physically confrontational with others but usually he's calm and contained"
SID000860,SmashWilliams,"Smash is another one of the football players on a team. He's depicted as very aggressive and uncompromising and short-tempered and he shows this in the way he plays football on the field he is confrontational he doesn't show much regard for what others think or how he's supposed to behave he's not very welcoming of outsiders...(long pause)...
 he's short...(long pause)... he's arrogant"
SID000860,TamiTaylor,"Tami is Coach Taylor's wife she's shown to be a good wife she loves her husband and her family she plays a mix of housewife and also a working woman she is very motherly she's caring 
 she's very religious she prays very often she's supportive of her husband's career even though it causes her stress...(long pause)...she's depicted as a genuine person she rejects gossip 
 she's concerned with material things"
SID000860,TimRiggins,"Tim is one of the players on the football team he's aggressive he has poor self-control sometimes he drinks himself into a delirium he broke up with his girlfriend he's very careless he doesn't care what other people think about him not even Coach Taylor he takes advantage of 
 the hospitalized state of his best friend and he hooks up with his girlfriend...(pause) he takes advantage of her emotional state 
 He's arrogant and he has a tough time getting over the fact that his best friend Jason will never be the same again he refuses to visit him in the hospital even though he knows that Jason really wants to see him he's very reclusive and isolated he shys away from socializing with others"
SID000860,TyraCollette,"Tyra is Tim's girlfriend Tim breaks up with Tyra when he's drunk Tyra is upset about this because it's very abrupt Tyra is also sought after by some of the players on the team she's sympathetic to Jason and she visits him at 
 the hospital to apologize for Tim not visiting him...(long pause)... she's one of the cheerleaders on the football team she's popular she has a lot of friends"
SID000703,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy is a very motivated person who has a clear vision for success which hinges on the success of the football team and the town rallying around them he works in close alliance with Coach Taylor to the extent that he thinks that his goal will be met but 
 is willing to take initiative and do things that he knows that Coach Taylor isn't totally on board with or will outright disagree with in order to get what he wants which is a winning football team at any cost he is somewhat oblivious to his daughter Lyla's struggle with her boyfriend's injury and paralysis and has to be brought 
 into it by his wife Lyla's mother he's a car salesman and many of the car salesman tropes that I'm familiar with are somewhat accurate to his character that he is not going to show all of his cards at once is that he's going to make compromises to get a deal done even though all of the costs of those compromises that might not be fully shown
 he's very confident about recruiting a quarterback who is a refugee from Hurricane Katrina and is very committed to seeing that person play and seeing that person perform no matter what the coach of the football team thinks about how to get what they both want which is a winning season"
SID000703,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor is a central character in the show as the new head coach of the Dillon Panthers with high expectations from everyone in his social and professional circles to take the team to the state championships to become state champions he encounters a lot of support from his family even though he is not always at 
 great at modulating his own emotions and a lot of that emotional turbulence on his end also comes from those around him Mayor the other coaching staff the other folks at the school just townspeople someone who starts a fight with him went out to dinner who have high expectations and little room for compromise and their own Visions about what he should be doing he 
 forges very archetypal male path forward not showing all of his cards being snide and ride in order to end conversations or change the subject he is a mentor actively plays the role of mentor and is willing to do things that are unpopular in order to follow his own vision of success he has 
 respectful but mixed relationship with his wife who he see sees I think as a lover and a confidant but also as a resource and also someone that he takes somewhat for granted and he cuts a figure of having to navigate a world with a lot of necessary compromise"
SID000703,JasonStreet,"You meet Jason Street as a senior at Dillon High School Star Quarterback sight set on the NFL being scoutered as one of the best quarterbacks in the area if not the nation at that time he has a nice car he has a nice house he's in a relationship a committed long-term relationship with his girlfriend Lyla and strong faith in the Christian tradition and a 
 big heart which you see in conversations with children and having been set up to love him and be invested in him the viewer experiences at the toward the end of the first episode a radical shift when during a pass play which is intercepted toward the end of a tough first game of the season the receiver of the opposing team or on the opposing team makes it through all of the offensive line and Jason is the only person left to prevent touchdown on the interception and so he goes in for a tackle inexpertly 
 suffers spinal cord injury at the junction of his neck and upper back vertebrae I think C7 T1 which we find out in half an episode leaves him paralyzed below the arms and
 Jason is hurt he's angry when he's not in once he comes out of being in direct pain he is realist about his chances even if his girlfriend does not and that's a point of tension and we see him developing into a much more nuanced raw interesting character over time as he goes through his healing process"
SID000703,JulieTaylor,"Julie is the only daughter of the new head coach and then also the new guidance counselor at Dillon high school she's is defined in the show primarily by her relationships with others she is very savvy in interpreting the interaction between her parents she can see when things are tense and she can find some humor to communicate to one of them 
 at the others expense without the other one knowing on her way out of the room to give them space she steps in to mediate between her parents also getting a head count for a big party for her mom's benefit from her dad and then doing the chores that fall to her when her mother is trying to pull that party off and she needs to go to the store and then be sent to the store again and again to 
 get more supplies she also is a dancer and her performance in a dance recital is both something that is a subject of conversation leading up to the event and then is a point in the show at which we see another relationship starting to define her which is romantic interest from Jason Saracen the new quarterback well second string become first string
 quarterback who is another key player in the show who has a crush on her and we've been seeing that crush developing very specifically for a while but when he ends up at the dance recital he finally said something to her and she probably sees someone fumbling around and it'll be interesting to see whether that subplot goes anywhere later"
SID000703,LandryClarke,"Landry is a loyal person that we encounter primarily through Jason Saracen he is an insomniac with a car and Jason uses that to his advantage by getting rides by from Landry to pretty much everywhere it seems like football practice school and since Landry is also with him most of the time that we see him out of the house as well like at the burger joint or 
 work perhaps to those places as well Landry is smart and strategic he has always got a plan he always has a critical perspective he is creative and a little quirky he spends a lot of time contributing to things that he think are worthwhile for instance the development of 
 Saracen as a quarterback on the team perhaps that's not entirely altruistic we don't know yet but he is fiercely protective of Saracen and his what is reflected on him from Saracen in the community of Dillon and the high school and football team specifically quizzing Jason on plays at work 
 coaching him on what kinds of things to say or just how to start talking on the camera fetching the football during passing practice in the front yard and just offering humor and another opinion on everything that goes on around him"
SID000703,LylaGarrity,"Lyla is a convicted person who functions well within her comfort zone and the familiar and who will extend that comfort zone to cope with unexpected change up to the point that it no longer works and falls apart and when that happens she can become more impulsive and hedonistic  we meet her 
 as the girlfriend of Jason Street the star quarterback who says I love you first most of the time until Jason gets mad at her and asks why the relationship should continue which is when she moves away from him and sort of falls into Tim's arms feels a lot of shame around it and the next 
 time we see them together she shows up late he says I love you first and she replies and a flip from their normal script and later when Tim shows up in her room she follows through on the feelings she has there outside of what she had constructed as her world she is a faithful woman in terms of religion and in types of relationships from an idealistic perspective 
 and is very convicted of her hope that the world will return to its center when it orbits away from it that Jason will get his legs back they will have a career that their lives will go on as planned and when her perception of the world is finally knocked out of that orbit she makes interesting improvisational decisions following her heart desires"
SID000703,MattSaracen,"Matt is just doing the best he can he was the second string quarterback for the Dillon Panthers right up until a major injury to the Star Quarterback Jason at a critical moment in the first game of the season and a very high pressure season and he becomes the focus of the show as the new starting quarterback for the Dillon Panthers he seems to have one friend 
 who drives him around and a close trusting relationship with that one friend but we don't meet any other friends of his we see him out and about but not interacting with other folks at least not successfully he is a very family-oriented duty oriented person he lives with his grandmother and is her primary caretaker setting out her pills reminding her to take them making her food doing things around 
 the house his father is active military stationed overseas and they have limited contact and when they do they don't always agree about things but Matt is not willing to argue about them he feels a lot of pressure from all directions and he expresses his feelings by drawing and making music we see a little bit of his drawings we don't see much else early on 
 but he channels some of that energy into a crush on the Coach's daughter which he realizes is unorthodox and have... feels very mixed about he also works a job and is susceptible to somewhat to peer pressure which gets him into trouble when his emotions take over while hitting opposing quarterbacks car"
SID000703,SmashWilliams,"Smash Williams is a star running back for the Dillon Panthers he's probably an upperclassman he has a lot of friends and also a lot of family and we meet many of them through the show he he's involved in love interests with a few of the characters but not for very long he is both ego-driven
 individual and a team player and we see both sides of him at different times he has I think a younger sibling or cousin and a mother or aunt that he lives with in an apartment we see that the place where he lives is similar to that of his peers socioeconomically but different from everyone else who hang out during the show who is an adult who have more resources around them
 Smash is interviewed many times he likes being in the media it seems like he has opinions we heard that there was a death in his family recently but he doesn't want to talk about it early on and that doesn't seem to come up much through the rest of the first few episodes Smash is good at rallying people who sings at a car dealership 
 to get people going before the first game he starts a group chant when everyone's out in the rain late at night although in a second case it was partly driven by him having gone on TV and giving an interview which the Coach disagreed with and which caused him to get everyone out in the rain in the middle of the night to run sprints up a hill Smash is a good guy but takes a long way to success"
SID000703,TamiTaylor,"Tami is somewhat very interested in doing right doing right by people doing things the right way doing the right things she we encounter her first in a one-dimensional way as the wife of Coach Taylor who is interested in moving into a nicer house who is interested in doing more than being a stay-at-home mom and overtime she develops into a guidance counselor for 
 the school doing a hard job but doing it well and holding her own in her marriage and with her daughter as a mother she is insightful she knows alot about football but is not seen as an authority on it by anyone other than her husband she is quick to play the social game of smiling and being nice with other women in the social circle who are very 
 Southern hospitable to each other she is willing to stand up for herself in her closer circle her family circle and point out when she is being taken advantage of and point out her perceived place in a situation and what to do with that role when she's under the table you know saying she'll be mad with her husband when they're under the table but she'll go back to 
 being a good host when she's up from under the table and she's interested in making it all come together and work and keeping things on track reminding her husband about her daughter's dance recital pointing out when he's getting to bed late trying to caution him against making rash decisions and we also see in her counseling of Saracen that she's insightful as a counselor as well"
SID000703,TimRiggins,"Tim is a cynical person but he is also somewhat idealistic he claims that he likes to play football and is good at playing it because he likes to hurt people and it's possible that that's because he's dealing with some of his own pain which he meditates on his own by consuming enough alcohol that those around him notice it and point it out as potentially 
 a problem he's very confident in his vision of the world at first which is why I call him an idealist he thinks that he's a great football player the greater football player than the person who lives with him who sort of acts like a father figure if  ever was and he makes plans with Jason Street toward the beginning to hold down the fort here at home while Jason goes off and has an NFL career and then they can 
 live large in Texas after that but when that vision and the coping patterns that he had established break down when Jason is injured Tim falls into a cycle of further cynicism hell farm  and on we seeming to 
 be confused and not want to engage with his old friend because he doesn't know how to interact with him now that he's partially paralyzed nearly quitting the football team losing his romantic relationship and sort of self-destructing overtime in a cycle of despair"
SID000703,TyraCollette,"Tyra is a very internally motivated and validated person she is in touch with what she wants and goes and gets it and is also in touch with what she doesn't want and removes it from her life she starts the show in a relationship with a star tackle or defensive lineman and 
 is flirtatious with others but also does a good job of managing his emotions and interactions or at least trying to play a role she's also flirtatious with Smash for a while and when she at her boyfriend are on the rocks she hooks up with smash once but does not so she gets kicked out of the apartment when they're walked in on by Smash's family and that seems to be the end of 
 that but as things continue to degrade with her and her boyfriend she drives the conversation in which it comes to a head that they're not getting along they don't have much in common with eachother right now they're not impressed with each other rather they're disappointed with each other and that maybe they should not stay together and she also forces the question of whether it's worth doing and then makes a decision to drive away 
 she's perceptive and she's good at finding and getting what she wants she is also defined partly in opposition to other girls in her social group she seems to be more independent and less driven by what will make her popular or what will make her attractive rather more by what makes sense to her"
SID000861,BuddyGarrity,"this character is an alum of the football team so he played himself in the football team he is very dedicated to the success of the team even after his  years of playing... playing the football so when Jason goes to the hospital he makes it his goal to find a new quarterback that will replace him and have an equally successful team if not even better he is devoted to the team he attends all team dinners and events he
 he promotes the team he advocates for the team  on a daily basis he wants the best for the team he himself is willing to raise funds to have this new quarterback come in from he's a victim from Hurricane Katrina not not not this current character but the quarterback he's trying to bring in is a victim of Hurricane Katrina and this character wants to bring him in so he could have played for the team as a quarterback and help the team win 
 the state level yeah he confronted the Coach the current Coach because he wasn't pushing the team hard enough so that's how much he really wants the team to succeed he confronts the Couch he's frustrated that the team is not succeeding so he goes out of his way to see search for ways that will ultimately make the team better and help them win 
 all the games that they can"
SID000861,CoachTaylor,"this character is mainly the driving factor for the success of the football team he understands that the team has to be pushed hard to be able to persevere and in doing so he must dedicate his time to make sure the team is working hard day and night he goes to the extent to which he breaks he brings the team together late at night maybe around 11 or 12 p.m. while it's raining and he makes them climb hills back and forth 
 to make sure to tell them that they should be working hard and that hard work gets them to where they want to be his main point is that there should not be there should not be mercy for them this happens mainly because he wants to win the state level as well he's very compassionate his quarterback he wants to get his quarterback to be where he was... to the point where they will be able to score throughout games and in doing so he offers him advice throughout the film he 
 take cares of him almost as if it were like his second child so that's one of the characteristics about him he also hosted events in his house with his family for the football team to increase the the spirit of the team he also cares for his injured quarterback and he visits him he visit him at the beginning of the film although it didn't happen much in the rest of the film he did so in the beginning and thinks about him throughout the entirety of the film you could tell 
 yeah he's the main driving force of the football team and he just wants them to be able to he wants to push them as far as he can because it's a lot of pressure on him to have a successful team"
SID000861,JasonStreet,"so this character is particularly in a tough situation so he at the beginning of the film he's a the typical high school quarterback so like he's popular he has a girlfriend who is a cheerleader of course he hangs out with popular people but later on in the flm he's in a particular difficult situation after he is sent to the hospital after an injury in one of his games and he's furthermore paralyzed with his arm and with his legs he can't really do much he's really  
 frustrated he's at the hospital for the entirety of the of the season and there he is accompanied by his girlfriend and she's like praying but he himself gets very frustrated with the situation yeah he I think everybody would be in the same situation everybody that would be in that same situation as him 
 would respond in the same way but he was very frustrated he was very mean to those that were trying to help him which is understandable because he lost basically his future he saw himself as being a professional quarterback and given his circumstances it is all for the more lost  because of his situation he can't move so yeah he's frustrated he acts mean yeah well people give him hope he just 
 kind of rejects it like he doesn't want to be given hope because he wants to accept the situation that he's in and furthermore understand that things might not get better for him so like yeah he he is mean but it's all reasonable and I feel like anyone within his situation would be that way so yeah"
SID000861,JulieTaylor,"so this character is throughout the film she's a daddy's girl she requires a lot of attention from her dad although her personal her physical appearance might not might not presemt her in that way it might actually present her kind of like a timid girl and shy girl that doesn't need the attention that I mentioned but throughout the film she does this character is also a dancer she dances for a school group and yeah she's very a daddy's girl 
 throughout the film there is one guy who tries to who sends like very light signals that he's interested in her but she pushes him away almost because like she I don't know why it just happens she just pushes him away doesn't really get the hint that he's into her yeah she's a daddy's girl she does a lot of things for her dad and she gets upset when 
 well she got upset when her dad didn't remember that she had a recital on a certain day and that's like yeah that's that's understandable but yeah the main characteristic of her is that she she's a dancer she's not really  portrayed a lot throughout the film other than that she other than that the quarterback is interested in her so like 
 that's the main thing that happens with her"
SID000861,LandryClarke,"if describing this character the first thing you would look at would probably be his appearance his appearance could be a little bit tricky he kind of looks like kind of like a tough guy a tough high school guy but looks like a mixture of that and kind of like a shy guy a timid guy but throughout the film we are able to tell that he's actually very shy very timid so he is best friends 
 with the introverted quarterback and you know when you have a pair like that you can tell that they're both they both have similar personalities the this character is not in the football team but he enjoys the sport and he would like to be on the football team he seems kind of nerdy very book oriented kind of like one of those students who aren't very there... who 
 are't really popular but they would like to be yeah that's the main characteristic of this caricature he really cares for his friends which is Matt and he's a new quarterback for the team so they're kind of like best friends they do a lot of stuff together yeah but they go out together he supports his best friend so he encourages Matt to practice at the beginning of the film he practiced a little bit with Matt so that he 
 can improve and he cares for his friend so he's like he's not selfish at all and he really cares for his best friend which is like a very admirable characteristic inside of person"
SID000861,LylaGarrity,"this character is a cheerleader for the football team she is probably the cheerleader that is the most devastated by the the major injury that happens to her boyfriend which is the quarterback of the team which leads him to be hospitalized and furthermore to be paralyzed from his legs or his arms alhtough her boyfriend does gain a little ability she does not leave his side at any time 
 her voice is a little high pitch and at a first sight you wouldn't think that she is compassionate at all you would think that she's kind of selfish by her physical appearance she's kind of selfish and cares about her own appearance a lot but throughout the film you could tell that this is obviously not the case that she really cares about her boyfriend and even though he's paralyzed she goes to the hospital everyday and shows him support even on her own birthday she should goes to visit him 
 instead of going out with friends or family members for dinner so yeah she's very compassionate she really loves she really loves her boyfriend she wants to eventually marry him so yeah that it that was like I didn't expect that from her although it may sound bad but judging from her first appearance as I said before her character traits that I would have thought of would have been different but throughout the film you could tell 
 that she's very nice she really cares and she's very understanding like she wants her boyfriend to get better and she tries her best to do so. she takes care of him she feeds him and she keeps and company every day and night"
SID000861,MattSaracen,"this character can be perceived as humble and kind very very like a timid and introverted kid he was mainly on the sidelines at the beginning of the film and not until the quarterback's injury or hospitalization was it when he stepped onto the field to be the quarterback his priorities are his priorities are making sure the team succeeds but also that 
 his life at home is also successful he lives with his grandparents he doesn't have any parents or he has parents but they are abroad one is in the Army and the mother is unknown. So he has these priorities in his family and in his football team it got to the point to where he had to drop precalculus at school so he could dedicate more time to football and to work he works in like a burger place in town. He's very shy 
 he has a crush he has a crush on this his coach's his coach's daughter and he never really approaches her and kind of flirts which it it it's just like a sign that he's kind of an introverted and wouldn't do a thing outside of his comfort zone although there's some there's one instance throughout the film where he does go out of his comfort zone because he's angry so he goes out and destroys a car of his rival of his rival's
 quarterback and does this out of anger because they destroyed their gym and everything in it so yeah basically in conclusion he's the main character of this film he wants his team to succeed he cares for his grandma at home and is very introverted and doesn't like to do things outside of his comfort zone"
SID000861,SmashWilliams,"cool so this guy is a character who is part of the football team he really thinks that he sorry he's really really frustrated by the situation with Jason becomes well goes to the hospital he's really frustrated by that and throughout the whole film he seems frustrated by not having Jasonas a quarterback and by having Matt as the new quarterback 
 and when we have the third new quarterback he seem more frustrated because he seems to have superiority he wants to be superior to this character that I'm talking about so he gets frustrated by that and he's frustrated that he the team isn't preforming as well as it could be which is the main like daunting factor for him I think yeah so that's like the main characteristics of this character he's part of the football team 
 he is really dedicated to the team but also gets frustrated although he is frustrated he still cares a lot about the team there's not much to say other than that"
SID000861,TamiTaylor,"this character is very nice she is the high school counselor in the film she is very caring actually she is she's particularly very caring with her with her family especially specifically her husband she really cares and is very understanding throughout the film she really it is evident that her fam...that her husband is dedicating more of his time 
 to the football team and less of his time to her she understands that he does have a stressful job and so yeah she's understanding of that she particularly so yeah she's very understanding although she could get frustrated at times like there's one instance in the film where they are hosting a party at her house for the football team and the husband didn't give her a 
 advance notice and she had to prepare the whole party within two days time and she was very flustered at that but she wasn't willing to show it so like she wants to portray that she is happy that she doesn't really get hurt much but inside she's really frustrated about that because she didn't have enough time there's a situation in the film where something falls underneath the table at the party she goes underneath it to pick it up and her husband goes down her with her as well and she explains to him that under the table she's 
 really frustrated with him and that she's not happy with the situation but above the table she will be given her she will give she will be giving him a smile and pretending like everything's alright in front of everybody else and  that she's willing to so she forgives him later on in the film and that demonstrates that he she is compassionate and understanding and she really does love her husband and her family"
SID000861,TimRiggins,"this character is the best friend of the main character that was in the car accident sorry not sorry not a car accident that was in the football accident Jason this character can generally be perceived kind of like a druggy or an alcoholic throughout the whole film this is mainly because he blames himself for what happened to his best friend for his friend being paralyzed it goes to the extent what  he's so depressed where you could tell throughout the film that he's so depressed and you could see his 
 physical appearance at  points out the way he acts yeah you could tell  that he's depressed he goes to the extent of hooking up with his best friend's girlfriend and that's just like a major turn around because I feel like he was so depressed and he did those wrongs keep that the strongest I could do that wrong which ultimately led him to feel even more depressed about the film 
 cares about the team as well do you want them to succeed although it got to the point where he almost quit once the team because he just couldn't bear the thought that it was his fault that his best friend had her paralyzed so later the Phelps Kiki was about to give up but came back and dedicated his time to the team and make sure and ensuring that they were doing as much as they could"
SID000861,TyraCollette,"this character is very pretty she drives a pickup truck she took other phone she has a boyfriend who can I proceed as I kind of like an alcoholic or drug addict she really cares that her boyfriend is visiting his best friend at the hospital so I can make sure all throughout the whole town is to persuade 
 her boyfriend to visit his best friend Pikachu understands but he feels guilty but then she also confronts him and tells him to a staff here she is very have a empathetic and sympathetic as well she wants cheaper seats at her boyfriend's medicine if he seems to fail and doing so so she she breaks up with him because he 
 about anything anymore so she feels that she is responsible to go and apologize to his best friend for having her boyfriend office at him cuz he goes to the hospital she better never apologizes for that take me to liquor made her main purpose in this question to be but that doesn't happen it's just feels bad for that so she does it herself 
 just carrying and she has the definition of herself whatever this phone took the main characteristics of this character yeah"
SID000862,BuddyGarrity,"so this is about Frank Garrity I believe was his name I can't believe I forgot already but basically he's a big deal in this town he's the mayor and he's super into football he like ties football to the success and prosperity of the town so apparently if the high school team is not winning people in town get real weird which there is some evidence cuz there's some vandalism in the locker room or at Matt Saracen's house 
 there was a sign in front of his house so people of town not just of the high school the  rivalry is pretty intense people really want to see the team win he goes through extraordinary measures by kind of poaching this out of towner this this quarterback from Louisiana whose family lives in Texas because they're refugees from the from Hurricane Katrina so the show is kind of interesting in how they incorporate these real life events he just seems like a laughable mayor who's a definitely way too intense about football and 
 and that gets in the way of like a football coach for him for sure and  bunch of other white guys about kind of makign sure their team wins (? and tries to bering the coach in on it but coach is kind of an above all guy  from the game so yeah he's a old white guy a little overwieght  and that's his role in this series I think he wears a cowboy hat sometimes and what not he'a not positive and he visits the coach a lot or has visited the coach a lot to 
 talk about football and like who's he going to play and the line up of the players and stuff like that so yeah that is him yeah he's not too bad of an actor too"
SID000862,CoachTaylor,"coach Taylor what a heartthrob he seems obviously very dedicated to the sport of football he is a coach seems like he had a pretty good run of it himself when he played as a youth he mentioned vaguely  once how his father always thought he should have gone pro but all in all his life is very fulfilling he's coaching football the best team in some town in Texas where everyone is a little way too obsessed with football he's protective of his family also
 his daughter if they're not winning or whatever I don't know why people would  anyway his relationship with his wife he's very fortunate to have her she cares about him a lot  esecpally cuz he apparently forgets literally everything to the point of being comical but isn't  related he's he's kind og like a stern guy but but not in a bad way he trying to learn to talk to his players more about their feelings and stuff like that from his wife and a little bit of that he a he's vaguely aware of shoot did I forget his name 
 already well well well the  quarterback have his having a crush on his daughter so that's kind of funny and yeah he's one of the charaters that isn't blonde in this story I guess some of them are not blonde  he was white but that's okay he's got nice hair hair is important and oh he kind of has some issues with the mayor who's like way too  obsessed with football and keeps on trying to 
 like recruit people he just also  played good on a sport that's a big part of his personality  as they mentor and coach throughout the episodes"
SID000862,JasonStreet,"Jason, see I knew that, I'm just really bad at recall, but anyway he is or he was, the first episode, he's the Golden Boy of the football team, is a Star Quarterback, nobody can do what he does and then tragically right as the game was about to end he tackles ? the other players ? the other team is going to score and gets severely injured, has to be carried off the field, and we learn later that he has been partially paralyzed and it 
 looks like he will only be able to regain full function of his upper body, arms, and hands. Of course it's tragic and it sets ? and the actions in motion for the rest of the episode. His girlfriend Lyla G visits him often, she's kind of annoying and she refuses to acknowledge that he will never walk again and is convinced that there will be a miracle from God but honestly since this is television that will probably happen at some point, I'm saying like season two.   
 He's you know he's a nice guy, he's you know slowly starting to like really pursue his physical therapy when his roommate kind of badgers him a little bit. He has no idea that his best friend's, also an alcoholic on the team, made out with his girl and it will probably not be while before he discovers that. He's handsome, he's tall,
 has the support of the team behind him and he's still supportive of the team, he watches the games even though he's now paralyzed in his hospital room. His parents come and visit him, his parents are like nice people and he gives the coach advice on how to best reach out to Matt and help him be a good player and stuff like that, so we see his struggles you know kind of separate from the other struggles but his struggles are what put this whole thing in motion."
SID000862,JulieTaylor,"Julie Taylor is my favorite character on the show. She's like the only one in the town that isn't obsessed with football, it probably has something to do with her dad Coach Taylor being the head football coach of the best high school team in town. So she's really cool, side tangent: she apparently performs at dance recitals. But generally she's kinda sassy and kinda just shoots down guys who like wanna talk to her, like
 notably the protagonist of the series which is this like nerdy guy turned quarterback now that the Star Quarterback is paralyzed. So they, he definitely has a crush on her and she's nice to him but definitely standoffish. So she seems really nice ? good relationship with her parents. She helps her mom out with errands and things like that and she gets you know kind of frustrated when her dad is 
 too busy with football to make it to family events. But out of all of the characters she seems like she has a good head on her shoulders and she's totally gonna get with the nerd turned quarterback guy at some point the series. She seems like she has a good sense of humor, funny, she has a lot of sassy things that she says, 'sass' is such a weird word, anyway...  She's blond, she has bangs, 
 There seems to be this whole drama with her family like staying in Texas or staying in their town, hinging on the fate of the football team, but didn't fully catch that. You know she's... yeah. Her dad always defends if anyone tries to mess with her about football, so that's nice. And yeah that is Julie Taylor ... in that show."
SID000862,LandryClarke,"Landry he's the ultimate sidekick to our Matt Saracen. He was BFF's with Matt before the hype, he will be BFFs about during the hype, and probably after. He doesn't play football but he does you know, watch Matt as Matt plays football and just give him pointers and help the memorize plays and they both work at some fast food joint together, or maybe he doesn't work there, he's just hanging out. But anyway, Matt's best friend 
 he is a lot more eager and dorky about girls than Matt is.  Cuz Matt's like sweet and stuck up on Julie and stuff but he like you know he's still kind of got his head in the game, he's like a nice boy. His friend, Landry over here, is just a complete dork and kind of like excited about the prospect that more girls will talk to him and his friend now that Matt is on the football team starting as a quarterback now.  ?? He hangs out at Matt's house a lot, so obviously 
 the grandma knows him, one of the few friends who does that and he's, I mean as far as physical parents go, he has to be the palest character in this show, which is kinda saying a lot. Not in a bad way though he's just very pale, very blonde, average-looking features, and you know, nice smile, average height. Yeah I think he adds to knowing Matt more as a person, you see them hang out, what his friendships are like one on one and 
 really not much to say, what else about that...so yeah that's kinda, kinda it. He's in a lot of the events, kind of a sideline character. ? seen throughout the episodes. Yeah."
SID000862,LylaGarrity,"So I missed the screen that showed whoever this was but on the off chance that it was Lyla, did I already talk about Lyla? No, I don't think I did. She's the girlfriend, she's got long brown hair, bangs, and she her voice is kind of annoying but sweet. She is dating the guy who got injured, I can come back and talk about this later, but she was a cheerleader she's very like dedicated, visits him all the time.
 She does make out with alcoholic best friend Tim at some point in the series but she feels really bad about it. She's like 'No, we can't!', but then her and Tim end up like hard-core making out, maybe going for it in her parents house which is just wild. People on these shows these days... anyway so she's a character in the show, she's pretty, she's kind, she seems like a little off-balance though, so I feel like in that sense 
 maybe her and the alcoholic guy would better go together. She needs to grow, she definitely is gonna have a ? in one of these seasons at some point. She's really into like fundraising and stuff like that and always having a positive attitude to the point where I think she just needs a stress relief so that she can learn how to, I don't know, deal with reality. Her family are concerned, her parents are concerned about her for spending so much time with Jason in the hospital 
 and she's really just trying to make sure that he's not forgotten about. So yeah, that's Lyla. Hopefullly that's the person that popped up but, I don't know, I don't remember. I might have to go back and fix that later. Yeah. ..."
SID000862,MattSaracen,"Matt Saracen! Yay, I was right, I said his name, I think  either Matt oh well but it's not , so Mattie boy is so nice it gets very confusing cuz he goes from like the first episode where he can't even throw a  football through a tire, to like coming in and then surprisingly like holding on to the win after the Star Quarterback falls to the ground dramatically injured, we later find paralyzed, and Matt just helps the end of the game 
 scrapes by, they win the match and he shows like this hopeful he gets a lot better, he's improving at the sport he's improving in his confidence, and we just want to see him really learn how to play the sport well, to reach his potential as a football player. His home life is happy but kinda sad cuz he lives with his grandma who's like increasingly suffering from dementia and his father is overseas fighting in a war in the military either in Iraq or Afghanistan, I don't remember. 
 But so that's Matt, he has a huge crush on his coach's daughter Julie and so he tried to talk to her but she rebuffs his advances often. He has a good buddy from pre, from his pre-football semi stardom days who's a huge nerd and is always like, kinda there as a sidekick helping him try to remember plays or watching him try and throw a football through a tire. Seems like he has a good relationship with coach Taylor, or just start to,
  he goes to Coach Taylor's wife's like counseling hours once cuz he he wants to drop a class so he can focus on football and honestly just like talk about his insecurities because it looks like their team is scouting like a star football player who's from out of town. But that's Matt, he's an endearing character. He seems like he's growing a lot, becoming a lot more confident and excelling at what he's doing."
SID000862,SmashWilliams,"Okay so Smash is a character on the football team. Notibly, he's one of the few, only, black characters on the show. I think we see his family briefly when the coach goes to visit his house, and the reason the coach goes to visit his house is he's upset because Smash has been on TV questioning his coaching, so that is a little bit of his character and that leads to some serious
 late at night training and team bonding. So as much as Smash talks smack, cuz he does, he's one of like the most dedicated play on the team. He is dedicated to the sport, dedicated to working hard, dedicated to like bringing the team together and a lot more sportsmanship then his alcoholic buddy on the team so he talks a lot of smack, but he shows some, some integrity and he's funny sometimes. He made out with his alcoholic teammate's 
 sneaky girlfriend for a little bit cuz he was annoyed with her and she was annoyed with him but that never really went anywhere cuz his mom got home and was like oh hell no. And then just like kicked the girl out. And that was when we saw his family a little bit too. I think it was either his grandma or his mom. But anyway, that's Smash. He, they all hang out in the diner a lot so he'll be there with like his buddies well I guess yeah, I guess that's the other like African American characters in the show, cuz all his friends, he's just, wow it's very segregated.  
 And then the alcoholic buddy, they'll like get into arguments sometimes in passing but yeah that's Smash. He seems, when he first introduces him, he's like talking to reporters as usual running his mouth but he works hard and he takes the the nerd- turned-quarterback with him on a joyride where they go do some friendly smashing of cars of rival teams so I don't know I guess he reaches out to every..."
SID000862,TamiTaylor,"Okay so this is Tami Taylor, I got confused cuz the actress's name is Connie Britton, so I hope that's right, but her last name is definitely definitely Taylor. Mrs. Taylor is the wife of Coach Taylor. She seems real smart, real nice, real loving, definitely sassy like her daughter cuz she totally gives her husband flack for forgetting about family events and stuff like that. Kind of like early on the series she tells her husband 
 that she's ready to get a job again and becomes the guidance counselor at the school. It would be cool to see more of her as a foil to Coach Taylor to get more of the emotional side of the characters' lives but we see a little bit of that when she talks to the nerdy-guy-turned-quarterback who now I'm thinking his name is Matt or well .... yeah anyway she has long sandy orangish hair and she's real nice looking and they did a good job of casting cuz she looks like Julie, 
 kind of. And she hosts a party for the whole team on like a couple days notice cuz the coach forgets about it so her and her daughter Julie are going crazy like buying all the ribs at the supermarket and stuff like that. But she seems like a great character, she has a good like teasing give and take relationship with her husband and she you know I think she enjoys her work as a guidance counselor, I don't really know but it seems like it's going well.  
 ... and yeah that's her.  Average height, fair skin, freckly, ... probably nice nails I think, I don't remember. Yeah."
SID000862,TimRiggins,"Okay so Tim Riggins is a football player at a high school and the story's set in Texas, I think the high school football team mascots are the panthers, but that's not important. Anyway, Tim Riggins is a good player, he's valued, he's not the star, but he is a good player who's aggressive. His main issue is that he's low-key an alcoholic or high-key, I think everybody actually just like references and knows that he drinks too much and nobody like does anything about it. 
 And he shows up to practice drunk sometimes so that's kind of sketchy. He's supposedly the best friend of the original Star of the football team, but he doesn't visit his friend once in the hospital when his friend gets a serious football injury that leaves him partially paralyzed, so he has a lot of like inner struggle with that because he blames himself for not being there to like defend him or to like tackle the guy so his friend wouldn't have ?
 so he drinks a lot cuz of that. He has a skanky girlfriend that he like kind of breaks up but mostly is just like not communicative with so she gets fed up with him. And then his best friend's girlfriend is really upset because Tim hasn't visited his friend so she confronts him and then end up making out and now he's in love with his best friend who's paralyzed girlfriend and
 that's kind of sketchy, that's the last thing I saw. So yeah, that's Tim. He seems like the typical like conflicted, mysterious, sad guy that all the girls want to save so like that's his main thing going for him and football, that's also what this whole show is about. So yeah, that's Tim. Yup. ... Lives with his brother."
SID000862,TyraCollette,"So Tyra Collette, what should I say, I feel bad for calling her the skanky girlfriend all this time, but to be fair that's really all the series reveals of her at this point. She has like an on-again-off-again loosely defined relationship with the alcoholic football player who I think if I remember correctly his name Tim. At the beginning of the series she like makes out with him at his house, they make out in other places, doesn't seem like they talk much which is probably part of the reason why she got upset with him at
 some point in the series, cuz he's obviously not very... he doesn't really show affection or doesn't really ? the relationship, but honestly, don't fully remember why they got in an argument, she might have told him to go visit his paralyzed friend too, but anyway to get back to him she like makes out with Smash at his house for a little bit before she gets thrown out by Smash's grandma or mom.  So Tyra Collettte, she's, yeah she's really portrayed as a skank for the series, there's no way around it, 
 you know, just with the clothes she dresses in and just in the way she acts but she seems like she has, I don't really know what to say about her. But she's white, she's blonde like many of the other women in this series. I think we see her at the diner, she hangs out there too you know, Smash tries talk to her later but she's just kind of like 'nah, I'm over it'. She has a good dramatic scene where she confronts Tim, I'm just gonna say his name was Tim, and it's like you know, if you don't talk to me I'm getting in this 
 car and never going to come back, and he's just kinda like aiight. So that saddened hurt cuz you know you can tell she cares and she's hurt by that and she even visits like the paralyzed football player in the hospital and is like yo I'm sorry he hasn't come to visit you know he obviously misses you and stuff, he just can't. So she has a heart, she has a heart and everyone's nice to her too for the most part, I would say except for Tim. Tim's kinda  ..."
SID000863,BuddyGarrity,"okay so I find buddy Garrity to be the absolute most annoying character in this TV show and probably almost all TV shows I've ever seen he's just an absolute complete suck up and yeah I just like is up everyone's ass like it to get what he wants he is Lyla Garrity's 
 father he seems lilke a pretty devout Christian but I don't know he owns a car dealership but he all he cares about is football he's an alum of the Dillon Panthers and like won't let anyone forget it always talks about what he once did and like all the other alums wears his championship ring  all over the place is always talking to Coach Taylor and like asking who's starting that week and this and that and always trying to like 
 give pointers and trying to like insert his dominant opinion or at least what he thinks is and I find that super annoying yeah he just seems like a huge like know it all and he like literally isn't but
 he also seems to be one of the like most powerful men in town so that would allow him to act the way he acts and yeah I'm really not a big fan or fan at all of Buddy Garrity yeah"
SID000863,CoachTaylor,"So Coach Taylor is the head coach of the Dillon Panthers. He has a daughter Julie and he's married to Tami. He was just appointed head coach for this past season, before that he was just the assistant coach and has a ton of pressure riding on the him to be the best and bring this team to the top. 
 Riding into this season they're ranked number one in the state of Texas. And it seems like he has the most pressure on him every week and has the most stressful job in the town. Every week he seems to be either the most loved or the most hated person in Dillon depending on if the team wins or losses so his like-ability  
 in the town is completely depends on the success rate of his team. He is definitely a very determined coach but also a very caring father and a very caring coach definitely cares a lot about his players and goes out of his way to make sure that they are okay. And seems though he goes above and beyond to make sure that they are the best 
 people and players that they can be and that what's going on with them at home doesn't affect how they play. He seems to take a personal interest in all of their lives and tries to understand them as people not just as players. Probably he does have a lot going on, it seems that he can sometimes have a lot. ..."
SID000863,JasonStreet,"Okay so, Jason Street is one of the main characters in the show. In the first episode he was paralyzed when trying to tackle a player, which is really unfortunate cuz he was ranked number one in the country or the number one quarterback in the entire country, 
 and had prospects for many colleges looking at him. Yeah and then all of that was taken away because of his paralysis. He is dating Lyla Garrity, best friends with Tim Riggins. Everyone just absolutely loves him, he seems like the absolute sweetest person in the entire world and everythings just absolutely ? at school and everything but since 
 being paralyzed, it has definitely changed him and you see this transformation at the hospital this person with all this hope and life and is now into this person that is pretty sadistic and cynical and just doesn't have a great outlook on life or the current situation. And so that's just like definitely like his... 
 his injury is definetely something he's struggling with right now and he's also like Lyla ? is Christian and iw very religious and so it's something that his faith, I believe, is also saying that you can see him struggling with throughout these last few episodes as he's trying to understand why God would cause him to be injured and do something like that to him."
SID000863,JulieTaylor,"Okay so Julie Taylor is the daughter of the head coach of the football team at the high school. However she has made it a priority to not befriend or ever hand out with or try to be associated with any of the football players, although it seems like she 
  is about to befriend or become closer with one of the football players, one of the younger players. She's very sweet and very unlike a lot of girls at her school. She's very smart and she seems to although she is very close with her mom and her dad, she seems to live in the shadow of the
 football team and is kind of constantly fighting for the attention of her, always fighting for her dad's attention because he is so engrossed with the football team. She is on her school's dance team and really involves herself with her dance and her studies and really seems like a very sweet and 
 innocent character in the show. Yeah like I said, Julie tries to like go out of her way to not have anything to do with the football team except for the later episodes when she starts to get now one of the players a little bit better and start to hang around the team a little bit more and goes to a party with them. Yeah."
SID000863,LandryClarke,"Okay so Landry Clarke, I don't have like a ton to say on Landry, but he's just like kind of a nobody. He is Saracen's best friend. Landry literally doesn't do anything but attach himself like a leech to Saracen. No, a leech is harsh, he just attaches himself. They're always together, he 
 picks Saracen up every morning and drives to school and he spends his time at night at Saracen's job and just kinda hangs out with him there. Like he also, I'm not sure if Saracen's Grandma actually likes him or if she just like makes fun of him because he's there all the time and like they're close enough, but that happens. 
 But yeah he doesn't do any sports, just likes to hang around the team, but I haven't really gotten to know him or like learn ? seen him as a very supporting actor. He hangs out with Saracen when ... when he hangs out with Saracen's Grandma when Saracen is playing football 
 and they like watch the game together and everything. So he is like a, seems like a really great friend and seems like he'd do absolutely anything for Saracen. Like, I absolutely know that he would. ..."
SID000863,LylaGarrity,"Okay so Lyla Garrity is the daughter of Buddy Garrity and the girlfriend of Jason Street, She, like her father and Jason and most people in town, is a devout Christian. She is captain of the cheerleading team, but a lot of what she does, to me, does seem kind of fake, I don't know. 
 She seems a little over the top with her personality and her peppy-ness and her optimism especially after Jason was paralyzed. But, I don't... whatever. She... 
 what else about her... she seems threatened pretty easily by Tyra, she does not like Tyra at all. Which I guess is understanable becasue Tyra is pretty intimidating or threatening as a woman but ... I thought that Lyla was like very
 dedicated and devoted to Jason, but then in the second to last episode that we watched we saw, and in the last episode, we saw Lyla cheating on Jason with Tim. But other than that, she's been a super supportive girlfriend since Jason's paralysis. ..."
SID000863,MattSaracen,"So Matt Saracen was the backup quarterback for the Dillon Panthers until Jason Street was injured in the first game of the season and he and Matt quickly had to step up to the plate with very little time left and they were losing and in that little amount of time he was able to play a great game and brought them 
 back in and won. But Matt has a ton of pressure constantly also on his plate, he had to step into the shoes of the number one quarterback in, not just the state of Texas, but in the country and it's something that Matt struggles with every day when he wakes up, every day that he's at practice, and when he goes to bed, on top of his other responsibilities as being the 
 the man at home with having to take care of his grandmother while his dad is fighting in Iraq. He has also taken an interest in the coach's daughter but at the same time has grown increasingly close with Coach Taylor and I think that it isn't replacing  
 the fact that his dad is in Iraq, but he kind of used Coach Taylor as a father figure and it helps to have him physically in the same space as Matt while his dad is away and fighting. So he is very close with Coach Taylor and yeah."
SID000863,SmashWilliams,"So Smash is an extremely talented football player except he totally knows it and is not afraid to flaunt it and talk about it and show off and is just definitely one of the most cocky people in the entire show. His least favorite person on the team and in the show is Tim Riggins, and he is not afraid to show it and openly talks about it all the time. 
 .... He doesn't seem very close either with anyone in particular or Jason, but he was definitely upset when Jason was hurt and went to visit him and whatnot. I think I mentioned before, Tyra is, originally was Tim's girlfriend 
  hooks up with Smash and like goes back and forth between Smash and Tim and Smash allows it because he knows that Tim hates Smash and Tyra is Tim's girlfriend so he definitely does that to get under Tim's skin, I believe and happens every time to upset Tim. What else about Smash... he just love attention, he loves to be 
 in the spotlight, he loves to be number one, he hates losing and yeah, like I said before, his brand, his MO is definitely just that cockiness and being number one and having that attention, that limelight. Yeah. ..."
SID000863,TamiTaylor,"Okay so Tami Taylor is Coach Taylor's wife and Julie Taylor's Mom. She's also I think, my favorite character in the show, she's very fierce and strong-headed. In the very beginning of the show it seems like she might just be a stay-at-home mom and has been a homemaker for a while and then you see her 
 ? getting a job and she becomes the I believe the school guidance counselor. What else about her... she ...  being the coach's wife I think a lot comes with it and like being Coach Taylor she kind of can't go anywhere without being recognized and
 no matter where she goes people are just giving her advice that is just completely unwarranted. Advice like 'oh the team should do this' or 'they should run this play more' or do this and that and it's difficult for her often to know who her real friends are and rather than those who just kinda want to ... be her friend rather than those who want to get close to her in order to 
 know the team better, which also is, I also just find really funny because it's a high school football team. But that's just me personally. Yeah she, like I said before, she's very strong-willed and stubborn and seems to have a great relationship with her husband and her daughter."
SID000863,TimRiggins,"Okay so Tim Riggins is your classic bad boy in a TV show. I almost think that he kinda tries too hard to give off that persona, but that's just him. Every girl wants to be with him and but I personally think he's kinda gross. He is 
 one of the stars on the football team but comes from a pretty low income family, don't really, I don't think he's seen any parental figure in his life. He lives with his brother who's always drunk from what I've seen, does whatever he wants and then just plays football. He was dating or Tyra at the beginning of 
 the episodes but then they broke up and towards the end he became infatuated Lyla Garrity and is now pursuing that. So that's interesting. I think that he feels responsible for Jason Street becoming paralyzed or there's something going on there but he is or was  
 Jason Street's best friend but won't go visit him in the hospital anymore. And keeps re-watching the tape from when Jason got injured and so there's also yeah something going on there. But yeah he needs to kinda figure his stuff out, but he's your typical bad boy."
SID000863,TyraCollette,"Okay in all seriousness I'm still trying to figure out Tyra's role completely in the show. She began as Tim Riggin's girlfriend but seems to just stir up trouble and just kinda passes herself along from one player to the next, especially between Tim and  
 Smash who are two players that have both described themselves as hating the other. And she's completely aware of this, and defintely just seems as though she likes to stir up trouble between those two which then stirs up trouble between... she is also close with Jason Street but
 other than that I am not completely sure of her role to the show. Yeah don't really have much to say on Tyra yet, I'm sure she'll become a leading actress in the show.  
 ... Oh ???? she broke up with Tim ... I don't know. ..."

 yes"
SID000868,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy is the character that I hate the most. He's really despicable in the way he goes about things all he really literally all he cares about is winning and it's not even his team which makes it all the more annoying cuz like he's just trying to, I dunno, he's just trying to like live out like his former glory or just trying to like just like trying to, 
 like I know he's trying to give him like give his team the best shot at winning, but also he just doesn't care about people's feelings or like the team's emotions at all he's like 'oh this Katrina quarterback is gonna be the best kid' and like he like tries to come under the guise that he's like doing good for this kid, but like clearly all he cares about is winning the state championship, he doesn't care about the kid at all like he doesn't care about like that the kid's a Katrina refugee or whatever so he's really despicable.
 I really hate him. He's just all up in your face doesn't care what you really have to say either and he really seems like one of those guys who will like talk nice to your face and then like talk trash behind your back and also he just makes a lot of promises that he he can't keep cuz he's not in a position to even make those promises cuz he doesn't have control over them. And he really tries to force his ideas and thoughts on to other people. It's just ridiculous cuz like  
 you can like say your ideas but you don't have to try and make other people and pressure and put them into action just cuz you think they're the best like the best ones out there. He's a really negative influence. He just embodies like the idea that winning is everything and nothing else matters which is just despicable. Duplicitous. Just a two-faced character, I don't like him."
SID000868,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor's a really stand up guy who's really put through a lot just cuz there's so much pressure around the football team but I think that in spite of like all the struggles that he has to go through he really stays true to his core values, doesn't let the outside talk phase him and he has a really good support group because like his family is really solid all around too.
 He's really faced with like a lot of tough decisions to make especially within ? of the star quarterback, but I think he really makes the right ones and he really knows how to relate to the high school kids both, because like he like he's tough to them but he also shows that he cares and like he shows he's not like a heartless person who like only cares about winning and that's it. 
 Like it's like still very evident that he cares about them as people. His honesty, respect for others really, and really his tenacity and like ability to like know when to like hold back from like confrontation like when that guy was like trash talking him in the diner when he was ordering food with his daughter. Like he just knows when to back off and he knows like how to pick his fights and  
 not let people phase him. I think that's going to be really important for him like as like time goes on and like new challenges arise. Just a really good person, really good father, really good coach, really good human being in general and he's someone that is definitely going to carry this football team to glory and like he will do it."
SID000868,JasonStreet,"So the biggest thing with Jason and the biggest I feel about him, it's always going to be the biggest 'what if' he didn't get injured. Obviously if he didn't get injured, the whole course of the movie would be a lot different there wouldn't be honestly there wouldn't be like any struggles. Like the team would have been much better like there would have been none of that controversy. But also it's like really sad to see like how he starts out, like so strong, self-assured, 
 and like really confident and like really like a nice like good guy because like and he like has everything going for him and then how quickly that all falls apart, health deteriorates, and like how he just like becomes mentally just like unconfident of his ability to like ever become himself ever ever become himself again and like he doesn't act, he doesn't he like loses his confidence in himself
 and he also just like pushes away his girlfriend too which is like really sad cuz like Lyla was like super supportive of him but like he just he just like threw a fit at her and just like go away which was like, I mean there's like no reason to do that and it's just like really sad to see him taking out his frustration on someone who was just trying to support him, make him feel better. And then like when he's moved to the physical rehab center 
 he still just refuses to accept that he's ever going to get better and he really just like stops trying which is really pitiful. And like the guy ? went there and knows how to push his buttons. And I feel like towards the end we like really see him like realizing that like he needs to like work at himself to get better and he needs I think he realizes that he needs to start like making an effort in rehab and his life."
SID000868,JulieTaylor,"Julie is a very like solid, a really solid person and just a really really a good girl and like a like a really good daughter as well for the coach. She just kinda just minds her own business and goes about her own activities, doesn't like harm anyone, doesn't cause any drama, 
 in the story and like it's hard for her sometimes because like her father is the coach of the football team and that can result in difficulties with her like not being able to like have her father's attention all the time for like her recitals or something but I mean ultimately she takes it pretty well considering like that she's an only child and she's always helping her like she helps her mom and like she does all these tasks 
 without like too much complaining. I guess like the one thing I was like confused about was like how she kept on putting off the back of like Matt Saracen. She just kept on like not being receptive to his like advances until like the very end we saw like the beginnings of like her opening up at the dance recital, but I mean she's overall she's just a really good like feel good character in the story.
 Someone who like I don't know like I could definitely see myself like being friends with or like someone who's like really just like someone who's really nice and that's like really refreshing because like there's so much stuff that goes down in the story and like so many bad people that it's just like good to see like one character at least there's like a decent teenager."
SID000868,LandryClarke,"Okay Landry's kind of just there he's kind of just like Matt's best friend who he is like funny and like provides like the moments of comic relief. He's like 'oh like Matt like now that you have like a top tier girl like you know we should like go out with them together like I should get one too or whatever' and just like he's just funny, he's just there. I don't know I mean like he's kind of supportive of Matt 
 and the way like he drives him to practice everyday and like helps him out. But I mean besides that he hasn't really evolved into that big of a character in terms of the beginning of the series. I mean I can't making too much of a judgment on him just based off of like a small interaction like with the like with the rest of the people in the movie He just seems like just a nutty, funny boy who
 is there for laughs and giggles. Someone who just provides like comic relief from like the rest of the tense situations. He like wants things for himself but that's just like that's just the way he is. In terms of  like he like he like like the fame and glory that Matt gets. But I mean that's just, it's not in like a malicious way, it's just like in like a funny, joking way. 
 Yeah he's just like a funny character, there's really nothing more to say about him."
SID000868,LylaGarrity,"Lyla, even though she can come off as like ditsy or just looking like in Wonderland almost, it's like it's like very clear to see like she comes from a place of like well like good meaning and like support and she's and she's a very caring individual who is just thrust into a really hard situation because like her boyfriend 
 is like down and out and then like she somehow still has feelings for her boyfriend's best friend and it's just like it's really hard for her to leave him now because she's always been super supportive and she still likes him a lot but it's just like he's like kind of pushing her away and then like she kind of feels like oh like there's someone else out there who can make ? like something better and even her parents don't support her so it's really hard for her and like I understand that like all her 
 struggles that she has to go through and she really takes it all really well and she remains really positive throughout the whole ordeal, throughout the whole ordeal which is just like really remarkable. She shows like incredible mental toughness and mental strength and she's able to really push through and persevere when it when times get like super tough and like think seems super bleak. 
 Her positivity is it's it's annoying but it's also like like something that we need in the show because like if everyone was as like depressed as Tim was it would it would just make for a really depressing atmosphere, sad atmosphere and so like the Lyla's, Lyla really has a lot of internal struggle within herself and she has to find out what she really wants."
SID000868,MattSaracen,"Matt's a really mature boy who has to go through a lot and shoulder a lot of responsibility throughout the whole entire movie, with all of his football struggles and with his Grandma and his dad being in Iraq and then just being like thrust into a new light of like intense scrutiny, having to live up to one of the best quarterbacks ever to play the game in high school football. So he deals with a lot but in spite of that he
 has a really mature and grown-up way of going about it he knows his priorities, he knows what matters to him, and like he has like moments of like immaturity where like he's pressured into doing stupid things like beating up the car but I mean like it's just like you can't really fault him for that cuz like he's being pressured into it he doesn't really have a way out, he always could have said no but I mean it just the way the 
 series happens. He's a really good kid. I don't think that like many people in high school could go through what he goes through and like still come out so strong and mature the way he like did, like with no mother and like really just no family and like he has to be the man of the house with just his Grandma in there. I think one of the funny things about him is
 he's always trying to pursue the coach's daughter which is like really interesting and it's like really funny and quirky how he tries to but like continuously gets turned down by her but like still goes after her in spite of all that. And I mean he's just a really good really good kid, really good character, someone who like makes you someone who's like heartwarming and someone who knows like what he's all about."
SID000868,SmashWilliams,"Smash Williams is one of the characters who really like remains the same throughout the whole entire like 4 episodes from the get-go he's very, he comes off as very selfish or confident and very cocky about his football abilities and where he's going to end up in life. I think he's being recruited to the USC or something he mentioned that in the beginning and 
 as like the show progresses and and like a lot more problems start to occur with the quarterback getting injured and like teams expectations being too high, he sort of initially at first tries to like make himself brand himself as the leader but he doesn't do it in the right way and just comes off as like selfish and really probably and no like really like immature. 
 But then there's that one scene when they're running and like on the hills and like he establishes himself as like a true leader of the team by leading them in chants and like pushing them to like do more sprints and like really embracing the hardship and like finally accepting like his role of team leader and how he's supposed to be. He still remains like really cocky and also like when it comes to girls especially like 
 Tim's girlfriend he's always like trying to go after her and which just like highlights the immaturity again which I think is like a big thing for him about he's really about how he's really just just like your typical like high school boy who's driven more by like testosterones and feelings more than like rational like thought-out judgement."
SID000868,TamiTaylor,"So Tami is the mom, really the mom of the whole story. She's really supportive of her husband like even through all the hardships and all the stuff that he puts her through such as like throwing that party when like on like such short notice and like having to like, kind of like rushing around on the day of and like clean up after him but like in spite of that like she remains 
 on his side throughout the whole entire time and she also really cares about like other people who like aren't in her family too. This like like on top of like taking like the job for like extra cash for the family, she also like really cares about Matt Saracen and not just like Matt Saracen but also just like the rest of the team and like their feelings like what they're thinking like outside of football. And like she like really understands that it's not just about the game it's about like 
 human beings and how like and like their mental state outside of the game and like what hardships they're dealing with. So she's just a really caring person. Also like she's just like put under a lot of stress being like the wife of someone who's under so much scrutiny every day and she holds up to it very well. She's very strong, very mentally stable. 
 And she's not like one of those she's not like the typical women in as like in the rest of the movie where they're always like gossiping. She's kind of just like holds firm in her beliefs, doesn't let herself get sucked in to like all the crazy politics and gossip too much. Really stays true to her roots and doesn't let any of the outside talk phase her too much. She's kind of like the voice of reason to calm down the coach sometimes, get a little bit tough."
SID000868,TimRiggins,"Wow so Tim Riggins is really portrayed as a dark moody character who drinks a lot but doesn't share his feelings, he's a real tough guy. And it's clear that like beneath this hard exterior there's someone who's really soft and like probably quite
 broken inside and like he blames himself for a lot which there's like no reason to. And like he goes and like he goes through like struggles just as much as any other character does in the movie but the way he takes them is really negative cuz he just over-drinks, cuts himself off from people, and it's I wouldn't say it's shameful but it's more just like disappointing on like how poorly he reacts to
 hardships. He's not he's not mentally strong enough to just like accept things for the way they are and like try and make them better and move on, he's unable to do that. He also, he and Lyla also have like a thing that looks starts to like really blossom and it's like really confusing cuz like as Jason's best friend he doesn't even go see him but like then he starts like hooking up with his girlfriend which is just like wow like okay you can't go see your best friend 
 but you can go and like make-out with his girlfriend while they're still together it's kind of like he's really going behind his back and it's it's really distasteful as as a best friend and just like as a human being in general. So I really don't have a whole lot of respect for him like at the end of these four episodes, but I feel like as like time goes on we're going to see him really mature and he's like he's probably going to come to the realization it's like do something better."
SID000868,TyraCollette,"okay Tyra is one of like not even a ? girl, she's just kind of a girl who's really scheme-ish and devious throughout the whole four episodes. She's really she just you never know what she's thinking, but the one thing that remains consistent that she's always out for herself. She doesn't really care about other people. And like even when she tries to 
 come off as like she cares about Tim when he's like golfing on the side of the like canyon or whatever, it just doesn't seem genuine because we don't really see much of her thoughts or like her introspection throughout the movie and all we really like see is like how she's comes into like every scene like really like 'oh like I'm like the hottest girl ever and like you guys are all like not worthy of like
 my attention' and like she like really like plays with Smash and his feelings. She even hooks up with him at one point which is just like okay because she still dating Tim. She's just really not a good person, doesn't doesn't have respect for others, doesn't have loyalty most of all. She is nice to Jason Street at one point but she gives him a kiss which makes zero sense cuz 
 she's not his girlfriend which once again just highlights how she's a scheme and how she like doesn't know boundaries or just not even doesn't know boundaries, doesn't respect them and she just thinks that like 'oh I can take whatever I want'. So yeah she's just a really, if I had to say one word it would just be devious, devious character who's always plotting something."
SID000872,BuddyGarrity,"So Buddy Garrity is a just a community member who lives in the town of Dylan. He is Lyla Garrity, the cheerleader's Dad, Buddy is an older guy he looks he seems older than most of the other characters in the show and he's a little bit on the heavier side. He is very involved with the football team and very vocal 
 about what he thinks the coach should be doing whether that's the players that he thinks that should be used to play or the actual football plays that the coach calls. He's very critical and very involved and he uses a lot of manipulative tactics to kind of get what he wants which is basically another championship for Dylan High School, he's very passionate about it but his passion kind of makes him disrespectful 
 and again very manipulative and his mind can be pretty one-tracked and he just focuses on one thing without considering the other factors at play or the other important characters that should be involved in certain decisions.He just very he thinks he can speak for everyone and it's just very confident and  
 just a very intrusive person in that sense because he thinks he knows how to control the football team where he knows what is best for it without actually ever really being a part of at least not being an active part of it currently."
SID000872,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor is the new coach for the Dillon high school football team. He's the main character of the show he this is his first season with this high school so there's a lot of pressure for him to perform. He has a wife who is also the counselor at the high school and a daughter who is a student at the high school. He's a family man and a man with strong faith system but he 
 above all is very passionate about football and being a good coach and getting his team to the State Championship that's one of his biggest goals. He's a very hard coach, he really tests his players and put them through a lot both physically and emotionally but it's in hopes of creating a stronger team so that they can so tey can do well in the championship or make the championship 
 but it's very clear that he's under a lot of stress and a lot of pressure because not only the do the students and the high school want to win, but the entire town is so invested in the football team so he faces a lot of criticism for his plays and his decisions and he's not a man who can sit and take the criticism he grows kind of impatient and resents any kind of disrespect or criticism that comes his way but he 
 is growing and he begins to become more understanding of his students and also starts to play a more fatherly role in in their lives especially since most of them are going through a lot just generally or following the injury of the former starting quarterback. So he's really growing and getting past his impatience and anger to become more understanding."
SID000872,JasonStreet,"Jason Street was the starting quarterback for Dillon High School Panthers but during one of the first games in the season he ended up hurting his spine by landing awkwardly on his neck when he was trying to block he was trying to tackle someone, so or he got tackled, but because of that he ended up hurting his spine so he's now pretty much paralyzed from the waist below 
 with limited movement of his upper body and arms. He was he is everyone's favorite because he's the star quarterback and a big big member of the Dillon high school football team and the whole culture surrounding that. He is he was in the hospital for a while recovering and he's recently moved into a rehabilitation center 
 and he's been filled with these feelings of despair and just a lack of hope that he'd never be able to have the life that the he had dreamed for himself. He wanted to go be a pro football player, marry his girlfriend Lyla, but because of his injury he thinks none of that would be possible but so far at this rehab center he's discovered that he actually could potentially regain 
 some of his dexterity. He's able to throw a glass off of a table or swat off which is a good sign to him that he can get past this and maybe try to get closer to the life he used to have."
SID000872,JulieTaylor,"Julie Taylor is the daughter of Coach Taylor and Tammy Taylor. She is their only daughter and she's about 15 years old. She's shy and kind of timid, she seems to still be adjusting to the high school culture and probably the culture of the football and cheerleader kind of vibes and that whole that whole kind of dynamic that exists within the high school. 
 She also seems to be more of a mama's girl so she generally seems to have like a leaning towards her mom they have an interesting relationship. And she is a dancer, she does an interesting style of contemporary dance and she had a dance performance which her family attended as well as Matt Saracen.  
 She is the love interest of Matt Saracen but it's I'm not sure it may be unrequited at this point. She seems to be pretty pretty standoffish with her interactions with Matt Saracen and a lot of the other members on the football team, but I think that's because she's still trying to navigate her role as the daughter of  
 the prominent football coach."
SID000872,LandryClarke,"So Landry is Matt Saracen's good friend. He is probably in the same grade as Matt Saracen. He's tall and has strawberry blonde hair and is pretty humorous, he seems to be a source of humor throughout the show. He isn't an athlete or anything so he doesn't really partake in the football slash cheerleader community outside of his 
 connection with Matt and whatever Matt brings him to. He is like I said he's pretty funny beyond that he doesn't really play much of a role besides being a sidekick slash best friend to Matt."
SID000872,LylaGarrity,"Lyla is a cheerleader and she is the girlfriend of the former starting quarterback Jason Street. She is the daughter of a prominent town member. She is brunette and tall and slim. She is very hopeful for Jason's recovery and kind of deluded. She comes across as ditsy for a 
 good period of time because she doesn't accept the fact that her boyfriend is now crippled and a lot of the plans that they had for their future will probably not happen. Lyla is also kind of weak-willed because she doesn't really she doesn't know how to control her emotions that well which leads her to make rash decisions  
 like cheating on her boyfriend with his best friend and but other than that she is very supportive and she has a strong I guess faith system, she's very hopeful and she is just very committed to a her beliefs 
 and her religious hopes and what she thinks can help her husband her like boyfriend and her future. She's pretty one-minded, she doesn't really see the reality of things but that's how she is, she's very optimistic."
SID000872,MattSaracen,"Matt Saracen is the second string quarterback for the Dillon High School football team. He started playing after Jason Street had his accident. Matt is kind of, he's younger than the rest and he seems more naive and less confident, he doesn't really know much about his own abilities or who he is or where he stands within the high school community and even the football community
 and he's just trying to find his way and gain the confidence to be a good quarterback and to finally believe in himself that he is capable of taking the team to a championship and proving everyone in his life proud. He lives with his grandmother who's going slightly senile and his dad is abroad and is a solder in Iraq
 so Matt is responsible for taking care of his grandmother and making sure she takes her pills, making sure that she's safe, and that pressure of taking care of a family member and making his dad proud as well as fulfilling what the town sees is his duty as a quarterback to get the team to the state championship he's under 
 a lot of pressure. He's kind of dorky and he has a crush on Coach Taylor's daughter and so he make he tries to make multiple passes at her and plays and he plays the nice guy card a lot because he is one but she just isn't really picking up on any of it which leaves him just even more awkward and uncomfortable and dorky."
SID000872,SmashWilliams,"So smash is a football player on the Dillon high school football team. He seems to be probably a wide receiver or something of that sort. He is very adamant on going pro, he really believes that he will go pro, it's not a question of if but when to him and he thinks that playing for Dillon High School and getting to the Championships is his way of doing that. 
 And he is a very confident guy, he is wildly confident, he doesn't have much respect for the rest of his team members or anybody who really questions him or his actions. He usually just brushes them off or tells them off because he doesn't care about anyone else's opinions other than himself but and he's also a ladies man. He tries to get with a lot of girls and he's a 
 prominent figure I think with it especially within the African-American Community because it looks like he was originally one of the few if not the only African American player on the Dillon high school football team and he comes from what appears to be a relatively low income neighborhood or background just based on his house what we've seen of his house compared to the other members 
 but he is someone with a strong desire and commitment for what he wants. I think he just has a tough guy persona where he acts disrespectful towards authority figures but deep down he does understand the importance of discipline and he and of discipline and a strong cohesive team and teamwork."
SID000872,TamiTaylor,"Tami Taylor is the wife of Coach Taylor. She is played by Connie Britton and she is a very nice and gentle character. She's very hospitable she whenever Coach Taylor has something he she begrudgingly accepts and she fulfills her role and is a very supportive
 wife and mother. She is also a guidance counselor in the high school that in Dillon high school which is where she and her husband work. She is fiery and is willing to kinda speak her mind and put her husband in place whenever she sees fit but at the end of the day she still stands by him."
SID000872,TimRiggins,"Tim is a football player. He is probably defensive lineman and he is best friends with Jason Street. Football is really important to him but he comes across as potentially mildly racist or prejudiced because he doesn't like Smash. He's tall and has long hair. He is the on-again-off-again boyfriend of slash partner of Tyra. 
 Tim has a really tough and kind of just standoffish personality but within that he is very lonely and he really takes Jason's injury to heart and he thinks that he's responsible for it which leads him to make a lot of terrible decisions like never visiting Jason in the hospital because he's so ashamed, drinking excessively, 
 and eventually making the mistake of sleeping with Jason's girlfriend. Tim just is going through a lot emotionally and he has a lot of anger which he doesn't unload enough and throughout the show we see his methods of trying to address that anger and that sadness but a lot of them tend to be just self-destructive. He likes to really isolate  
 himself or just get drunk to avoid his issues, but it's not an effective way so we just see he's like he just goes through a lot of pain throughout the show so far."
SID000872,TyraCollette,"Tyra is one of the football players the one with the longer hair Caucasian one. His on and off girlfriend, they have a very tumultuous relationship. She seems to be the opposite of Lyla, she's more of a bad girl and she does what she wants. She's not held down by anyone or anything, she doesn't really belong to any community or is defined by any community aside 
 from what she wants to do and wants to be a part of. She has this tough-girl exterior, but within it she's actually seems to be very sensitive and a very caring person and she just wants someone to see her or I guess appreciate her, but she's struggling to communicate that feeling with people because of her own pride and also she just chooses the wrong people to find that within. 
 She has short blonde hair and she's tall has really long legs and is very skinny. She drives a truck, she cares a lot about her her boyfriend slash on-and-off-again kind of partner hook up whatever that situation is but she refuses to really let that show but
 during the show there's a moment where she really does put her guard down and ends up disappointed with the outcome but that shows that there's more to her as a character and there's probably some deeper issues that would be explored in the future."
SID000875,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy Garrity is Lya's dad. Unclear if he's a single father I don't think we've seen any scenes of him with his wife. Appearance-wise just like a kind of kind of big, like grayish blonde hair kind of put back in a mullet in a way. Personality-wise I think he's pretty 
 sleazy. Coach Coach Taylor's been trying to work on getting Saracen ready for the upcoming season and Buddy was  focused on recruiting another quarterback, this Katrina refugee and he put on this huge show about how he really cared about his family and his well-being when clearly he only wanted the football team to win so that didn't sit too well with me. 
 And like he went on the news with with the kid maybe like a radio show and he was like yeah like we're just so happy to be able to help him and all this stuff and he always he always finds a way to put Coach Taylor in a bad situation like at the barbecue he's asking about who he was going to start when like clearly he hadn't decided yet and things like that. He doesn't seem like he really cares about anything but the football team and himself so
 that's pretty much it. Not that important of a character in my eyes, other than bringing in Voodoo, but yeah."
SID000875,CoachTaylor,"Alright yeah Coach Taylor, I really like his character. He's he's put in a tough spot he pretty much only got the job as head coach because of Jason's what he said and he gives Jason all this time and he was supposed to lead them to the state championship. Now he has to deal with Saracen and now Voodoo and puts him in a tough spot because I think he's emotionally invested in Saracen like he saw him get beat up and he wouldn't rat his teammates, he's like 'yeah
 this is a good kid I want this kid to be a starting quarterback no matter his talent'. Then you have Voodoo who's just incredible but kind of like a dickhead so is like his life with football is pretty tough right now and then back at home is also also rough with his wife, I guess they just made up but he undermined her job like said it wasn't that hard like gave her really 
 late notice for the BBQ they threw and then pretty much almost missed his daughter's dance recital. So he's definitely, he's defnitely a dad I think who is so invested in like he definitely has a lot of love for the both of them but he's so invested in his in his work that that he's not able to properly show it to them because he just he just cares about the football team so much. I think he likes he's like the perfect amount of compassionate and aggressive I think. 
 Like he literally made them run wind sprints I don't even know like it was nighttime already in the pouring rain and then make one of the players walk home because one of them disrespected him on TV. And I think it was a long way being a coach, you have to gotta be able to understand your players as well as discipline them so I think that may play a role with Voodoo later and probably why Voodoo won't get the start because he has such bad attitude. Yeah."
SID000875,JasonStreet,"Alright so Jason street is the Talk of the Town. He got injured in the first episode, sorry he got injured in the first episode. He was committed to Notre Dame I think, he was thinking about playing professional football, he was literally I think the best quarterback in the state. Then he got injured and he lost the use of his legs, he got paralyzed and we've seen his character kind of change a bit from
 kind of the chipper inspirational guy that he was before like he would, he would like give speeches to like the Pee Wee league and all that stuff to a kind of more bitter guy as he evaluates what's going on with the rest of his life. We see him get in a fight with Lyla because he's like 'no, everything is not going to be fine, I'm not going to get to use my legs back like stop, stop being in this fairytale like like you gotta accept reality' and like as he's coming to terms with that and seeing other people in the same place as him at the rehab facility he realizes that 
 just how grim the situation is for him. At the end of episode four we do see him get a little bit more character development as he gets fired up at his roommate and slaps a glass off the table. I'm pretty sure that he hadn't even tried to use his arms or hands yet and we see him then we see him do that, like we see him look down at his arm afterwards like 'whoa, did I just do that'. So I think we're gonna see him finally coming to terms with the situation and accepting that like that's who he is now and then we'll see how his personality 
 changes after that. But I mean appearance-wise I think he is like 6, 6-1, 6-2 like I don't know. Pretty normal-looking, brown hair short not a buzz cut pretty short though. Yeah."
SID000875,JulieTaylor,"Alright so we have Julie Taylor, daughter of Coach Taylor and Mrs. Taylor. I'm not really sure what my opinon on her is yet she just started off, she started off to me kind of full of herself with when we saw her at the diner she's like 'oh I don't eat with football players and I don't eat with you.' She said that to, what's his name, Landry and Saracen, like I don't know she definitely thought that she was cooler than she was. And then she kept on she kept on curving up 
 Saracen when he just wanted to talk and I don't know he's a nice guy, didn't give him the time of day to talk, and then finally at her dance recital when he ended up being there after his fight, they had a pretty lengthy conversation and she seem like she actually enjoyed it. He was talking about Jackson Pollock just kind of being like his goofy self and like I don't know I think she found that ? kind of interesting. Yeah not much more to say. She's a dancer, she's long blonde hair. 
 Yeah I think that's pretty much it."
SID000875,LandryClarke,"Honestly I doubt I'll even talk for 2 minutes on this guy I mean he's he's Saracen's best friend, I don't know since how long but overall he doesn't really bring too much this show. I mean he drives Matt to practice, I don't know like spends a lot of time at his house. I think he has red hair, kinda fro-y. I mean, I don't know. He's pretty awkward around girls, we saw that when he tried to talk to 
 Julie. I mean he's Matt's biggest fan other than his grandma I suppose so. I don't know, that's pretty much all I got on him."
SID000875,LylaGarrity,"Okay so Lyla is a cheerleader. Like brown hair, I don'tk know average height. At the beginning of the show or I guess first two episodes first three episodes I really liked her. She's like immensely in love with Jason like they had this whole plan figured out. She was really sweet after got he injured, she'd go to the hospital everyday like bring him flowers like even on her own birthady decided to go see him in the hospital. 
 But then after her little fight with Jason where he told her to stop being so naive basically I realized that she was living in her own fantasy world and then she went and hooked up with Tim Tim which didn't sit well with me. Like her paraplegic boyfriend isn't getting better like he apologized and I don't know if she's, she did it twice, it was 
 recurring so. I also think that she doesn't like she doesn't really have feelings for Jason anymore because and she thinks she's like she said she was cutting things off with Tim and then ended up hooking up with him again. Showed up to his transfer late after she promised she would be there the night before. But she's definitely in a tough spot right now, just with  
 in terms of her entire plan with Jason possibly not happening anymore and with her new relationship with Tim which is going to make things very complicated especially since the town is so small and all they all know each other so. Yeah."
SID000875,MattSaracen,"Oh yeah so Matt Saracen is the backup he was the backup quarterback for the Dillon Panthers. He didn't get very much playing time because Jason Street the initial starting quarterback took all of it away so when he finally got into his first game after Jason was injured he was really nervous, not doing too well and then he ended up winning the game for them. 
 Personality-wise, he's a really sweet kid, he takes care of his grandmother while his dad's off I think he said he's in Iraq. He has like a pretty small little home, he has to make sure she takes her medicine because she's suffering from dementia so his life overall is pretty stressful because being thrown into the number one football team in I think the state of Texas as a backup quarterback, he now has to 
 keep the team together and keep winning games, is really stressful when you also have to be taking care of your grandmother and have no help from your parents. So he also has a pretty big crush on the Coach's daughter, Julie. And we've seen throughout the first episodes him trying to get her attention traditionally at the burger place and then season four ended with him actually talking to her for a pretty long time after her dance recital
 that he went to. He's also kind of susceptible to peer pressure as we saw when they pressured him into going to vandalize the rivaling teams car. Yeah, he said he didn't want to initially and Tim, Tim was able to convince him to. He's like a pretty average-looking, average height, white guy with brown hair. Yeah."
SID000875,SmashWilliams,"Smash, I mean, I don't really know if I like him or not. He's really impulsive, really full of himself, definitely definitely thinks he's a ladies man as we can see from all the scenes of him, all the scenes of him in the diner. I really liked when when Voodoo came to the party and changed his music and up to him because I don't think Smash has ever had someone stand up to him like that,
 maybe I guess he had Tim kinda do that, but no one's ever like stone cold made him go silent so I thought that was pretty dope. He he has a rivalry with Tim, I really think that's going to escalate to some sort of fist fight soon, especially since he hooked up with Tyra who was Tim's girlfriend. He's an incredible running back, I think he's 
 I think he's the only black main character not really sure. Like yeah incredible running back way way too full of himself off of the field though especially when Saracen had to step in as backup quarterback he kept talking a lot of trash about how he had to lead the team and how he knows what like what has to be done, so that's definitely annoying. We haven't seen too many family scenes, but from the looks of it even at home 
 he's way way too full of himself, like bosses his sister around, doesn't doesn't like doesn't help with the groceries, doesn't open the door for himself, he also single-handedly made the team run in the rain and do wind sprints up a hill. So he doesn't seem to care too much about the well-being of his teammates, just looking out for himself which often ends poorly for him. So yeah."
SID000875,TamiTaylor,"Alright so Tammy Taylor, Coach Taylor's wife, mother of Julie. I really like her character a lot. She comes off as really humble and really really willing to help out, especially since there's so much focus on her family with her husband being the head coach, she has a lot on her plate and then she decided to get a job and she wanted to help pay some bills or I forget what it was for to help pay for something. 
 And she ended up becoming a guidance counselor at Dillon High, which the coach thought was a joke and then she ended up kind of confronting him like 'my job is just as stressful as yours' and kind of this spite, I liked her then because she showed that she had this like kind of sarcastic like strong side to her where she wasn't just getting pushed around, she's like I'm going to do it because because I love you and because like I want ? to have a good time but like 
 at the same time, you need to know like I'm upset like and like I don't like what's going on and I think when, I can't remember the Coach's first name, but like I when he finally got that through his head he's like 'wow like your job is hard like I've been acting like an ass, like we should make up'. She's, I don't know, appearance-wise she's middle age I guess, long curly like dirty blonde-ish hair. 
 Yeah, that's pretty much it."
SID000875,TimRiggins,"So Tim is definitely a character who's going to have a lot of character development. We can see that he starts off he's introduced as this kind of douche-y like full of himself like kind of distant guy, like doesn't care about anything, like he's an alcoholic. But then as the episodes keep going and we see a little bit more of him we start to see that change. For instance, we see him literally break down in tears when he's watching the film of him, I mean of Jason getting injured because 
 he's like I didn't try, like even though he was on the other side of the field, he still blamed himself for his best friend's injury and we see that he doesn't even go visit him in the hospital like because he's so caught up with that and all the other characters getting mad at him for that but he's like really struggling with himself  as a person so I think we're going to see him build and become a little bit more trustworthy, a little bit better of a person. He like, he walked out on a practice because he just couldn't do it anymore, he like stuff like.
 And then he started having a little fling with Lyla which is messed up because that's both his best friend's girlfriend and and one of his friends so I mean it's very odd that she would cheat on him with Tim, but then he after the first hook up he says he can't stop thinking about her, so I think there's going to be some character development there as well in terms of Lyla to find a good relationship with Jason and then us seeing or that takes   
 her and Tim. Appearance-wise, he has really long hair, probably like 6-1, 6-2, I don't know. He wears one of those neck things when he's playing fullback so yeah that's pretty much it."
SID000875,TyraCollette,"okay so we got Tyra, I think she was an interesting character contrast next to Tim, primarily because they kinda had the same attitude at first. They're kind of like 'oh like we're like we're so cool like everyone, everyone wants to be us', stuff like that and we realize that's not really true. I don't know, Tyra I feel like in all four episodes puts on this act that she doesn't care about anything that's happening to her like she's like really blunt 
 when she says things. But then we see her when she goes to meet Tim when he's hitting the beer cans with the golf club and she like we see her true self come out: he's actually acting apathetic whereas she is trying to but realizes she can't and she's like 'is this really it? This is us like actually breakin up like this is how you're gonna treat me?' And he's like, 'yeah I don't care, I get it you're leaving' and like you just see her you're like she's like, she's like in pieces like she wasn't ready for all that. 
 She even goes to the hospital to apologize to Jason on Tim's behalf, which I thought was interesting even though they broken up, but then she she had also, she also attempted to hook up with Smash and then his family came home but still they were going to do that while she was still technically in a relationship with Tim so I think that was also a way of her cuz yeah cuz later on she was like yeah Smash I have nothing to talk to you about and he's like let's define what we are or whatever and like I think that was just an act to get at Tim like even Tim wasn't phased by that, but I think it's really 
 her putting on an act that's nothing fazes her, but she really does want to still be in Tim's life and it definitely hit her hard when she wasn't allowed to. So yeah. Appearance-wise she's just blonde, I don't know, like yeah."
SID000278,BuddyGarrity,"He's a great supporting character, he's he's got the look of a guy that's been eating steak for 50 years and hasn't taken care of himself which it appears that he has done. He owns a car dealership and has a lot of sway in the town and is one of the local you know business magnates. He also has and this is through line like all of the episodes he's one of the side characters that has endless
 opinions about how the local team that everyone loves and wants to win constantly, they'll, everyone has opinions about that team and this guy Buddy's the exception, he seems to have an influence over decision-making in terms of like recruiting players and gives lots of, applies lots of pressure to the head coach and that pressure is constant throughout the show and Buddy's one of those guys applying it.
 And the, he's also one of the people constantly giving like crappy advice like meaning like meaningless kind of like buzzword type advice about football like Smash Mouth football which doesn't really mean much unless you're talking about the Raiders in the 70s or something. He's got kind of some of the typical old guy characteristics that they have in shows too like slightly out of touch, 
 vaugely condescending to everyone especially women, not sure that's a commentary about self or if it's just about being an old guy. I think he's pretty wealthy but as I said before he's also just  appearance wise like gray hair, overweight, red face probably from drinking and eating steak. That pretty much sums up his character."
SID000278,CoachTaylor,"So coach Taylor is the head coach of this high school football team in this Texas town that really really values High School football and importantly he's from a different town so he's definitely an outsider. He's ? tough on the players, kind of in a stereotypical way, but comes across as maybe a bit more sympathetic to the high school football players. They definitely were in the town once but he's
 clearly good at his job, maybe better at it than the rest of the town thinks so or better at it than the assistant coaches who are from the town think. He's in his his forties, used to play football, it looks like he's still fairly athletic and can can kinda connect to the players pretty well because of that experience. 
 And he definitely has some of that kind of Southern type of politeness. I think everyone in the show does, but he does even though he's from out of town. It's not clear if he's a sympathetic character really, he definitely has a good relationship with his wife who actually works at the school as a counselor and his daughter who's a student there. 
 And he seems to be, you know, a reasonably good father figure, husband, but he's definitely obsessed with football and very concerned with being successful, but not necessarily if the town respects him and it does affect his home life so I would expect that to backfire on him in some way, He has difficulty handling stress which is a problem."
SID000278,JasonStreet,"Jason Street is the star quarterback of the of the Panthers.  He's the first string, respected by everyone, it's made clear that he would go go pro barring any catastrophic, barring any catastrophic injuries but he gets one almost immediately and it's probably the most interesting character probably the best actor too and has to deal with being partially paralyzed 
 for most of the show, maybe all of it. Everyone really likes him, he knows everyone, very popular, but unlike the rest of the team it doesn't go to his head. He's like very nice to the guy that replaces him as quarterback after he gets injured he played quite amazing I guess. He's dating someone, one of the cheerleaders, interesting facet of 
 that is that they're both very religious, a lot of people are very religious in the show, but he's a bit less religious than his girlfriend and even less so once he gets injured. But he's you know a resolute kind of character and tries his best to deal with his injuries, comes to terms with it pretty quickly, maybe unrealistically quickly, but it's an interesting aspect of the show. 
 He you know has to deal with being the most athletic to the least athletic very quickly. He has a close relationship with the head Coach Taylor they have a history, they've been like together on teams for years or a decade or something and it's kind of the only reason the coach got his job is because he's so close with this star football player on the team so they have a close connection to each other."
SID000278,JulieTaylor,"Julie Taylor, not really a central character yet anyway, by the end of the fourth episode it's pretty clear she will be I guess. So she's the coach's daughter, the head coach of the high school team, there's some kind of rule that she's not allowed to date players from the team, I'm not sure if that was, how that is a rule if he wasn't teaching high school before but 
 kind of follows that trope both like slightly antagonistic to her mom but like very you know nice to her dad, kinda like manipulates him a bit, is pretty clearly smarter than him in some ways. She's not ? with her otherwise I think she's 
 probably like 15 or 16, slightly younger it seems than the other High School characters. She's a bit aloof with some of the other main characters of the show, the kind of like second string loser quarterback guy, Saracen, probably cuz she assumes he's kind of doofus but he's not as much of a doofus in some ways. She's again like 
 pretty clever at least with her mom. She's on the dance squad, like hip-hop dance squad or something. Oh what else did she do... I can't really think of much else, towards the end of the last episode that we watch she starts to..."
SID000278,LandryClarke,"Landry may be the only comic relief character in the show. Friends with Matt Saracen. He and Matt are both, you know part of the underclass of the school because they're neither of them is like directly affiliated with the starting string football players at least at first I think Landry and Matt are each other's only friends at the beginning. 
 Landry's very aware of you know his position to the hierarchy of the school and he's trying to prove it by you know being friends with Matt and as Matt becomes more important to the team tries to like insert himself there a bit. Also quite awkward, like Matt, doesn't know how to talk to people but still you know makes an effort to talk to like
 women on the cheerleading squad and whatnot, doesn't pan out. Kind of kind of funny, kind of weird, he has like weird ideas about how things work generally like how the world works. Matt's grandma doesn't like him, I think just because he's not like clearly helpful for football or something or just cuz he's like the stereotypical
 strange sidekick friend. I don't know much about his backstory really but the main thing is that he's you know one of the one of the background characters that supports Matt's character, isn't on the team but like wants to have that kind of position he wants to be popular."
SID000278,LylaGarrity,"So Lyla Garrity. She is, so Street the first stringer that gets injured is her boyfriend. She's very religious like like for real like believes and it comes up constantly whatever anything she wants anything to happen. Like god is referenced. She was blinded by it, wants
 you know wants to pray away Street's injury. Comes across as very one-dimensional for most of the show like kind of boring. Daughter of Buddy Garrity I think his name is, the car dealer guy. She gets more interesting later as she starts to actually deal with the injury really like  
 come to terms that you know he might not get better. She's obviously very popular, she's on she's like a cheerleader or something like that and she is constantly like after the injury the alcoholic player doesn't want to go visit his friend Street in the hospital and she's constantly badgering him to
 go and it's just, you know that he's not a very good friend if he's doing that. And kind of think partially because she's you know so distraught over her boyfriend's injury she kind of runs to the arms of the alcoholic guy that she doesn't really seem to like a lot of the time, but she's got a close relationship with him and starts to hook up with him and ..."
SID000278,MattSaracen,"Matt saracen so he's the second string QB and his friends with Landry who is one of the nobodies of the high school. Matt Saracen is second string QB, not very good at football, at least in the beginning. Definitely a very thoughtful guy, meant to come across as a very sympathetic character.  Takes care of his grandma, lives with his grandma, his dad's in 
 Iraq, I don't think it's clear what happened to his mom or if she's alive even. So he's one of the underclassmen at school as a second stringer no one really pays attention to him. At first asked to step in after Street gets hurt and is like having a real tough time of it and the pressure in that town is crazy, when you're bad at football like it's brutal. 
 Starts to develop a close relationship with the coach and is also respected by Street even though I don't think they really know each other that well. He's kind of unconventional in some ways, especially as a football player he likes to draw, what artistic, well-read too. So he's definitely not your average stereotypical football player I guess. 
 Quite awkward, painfully so a lot of the time. So definitely an accurate depiction of a high-school boy. And he doesn't really seem to come out of the shell he's got this kind of anxiety to him like at all times he's kinda just stone-faced and anxious and circumspect but kind of..."
SID000278,SmashWilliams,"Smash Williams so he is the star running back of the team probably the second best player after Street, the best after Street's injured I guess. He also is probably destined for professional play. Extremely full of himself, hyper aware of how great he is and thinks he's even better than he is somehow. He's like a combination of Mike Tyson like Michael Jordan in terms of personality. 
 Always trying to get with the with the ladies in the cheerleading squad and whatnot. Kind of I guess like a caricature of a douchebag football player but is good at the game so it kind of balances it out I guess. Also talks to the media which is like shocking that that's a thing at high school possibly somewhere. 
 That character is sort of used to talk about racism of the town too and the history of racism in the south. He's asked about it occasionally and talks in the third person even about how he deals with it. Probably will develop later because it's pretty clear there's some like crazy racism in the town but he's not really developed much beyond being like a braggart football
 douchebag guy. Tries to get with Tyra or maybe does get with Tyra and it's also clear that Smash is like pretty poor and just wants to get the money and get the NFL. Kind of tries to take a leading role in the team after Street's injury but doesn't really have the personality for it."
SID000278,TamiTaylor,"So she's married to Coach Taylor, mother of Julie Taylor, one of the more interesting characters in the show clearly has more sense of independence, she's not subservient to her husband or anything like that, tells him where to go if necessary. She, for example, when they move into the town for the coaching job she takes a job at the school as a
 guidance counselor kind of like I think it would have been against the wishes of the coach of her husband, does it anyway doesn't apologize, also also probably smarter than her husband. But like respects how much he cares about his job. She also values football but not on the same order of magnitude as anyone else. Is kind of standoffish from the town culture, for example she gets invited to a  
 book club and it's with like some of the other women in the town, her daughter kind of advised her against it, it's kind of like subtle like we're not like them kind of thing. Turns out she's right, it's not even about books, they're just drinking and talking about football. So she doesn't like connect with people in the town that well, she's kind of like an outsider character, kind of like the audience I guess if you're not from that kind of town. 
 She also seems to be seem secure about her job and seem to care about the mental health of football players. This probably becomes a bigger issue later, she gets to know Saracen the second string QB, who's probably the most interesting character and she kind of like runs the household..."
SID000278,TimRiggins,"So Tim Riggins, a High School football players, offensive player, he's very close friends with the Golden Boy first string QB, Streeter. Aggressive character, not very well developed as a character, at least four episodes in. Some strife with him and the other players. He 
 is kind of in some kind of strange relationship with what's her name Tammy or the blonde girl and he has a serious drinking problem and really is like almost impressive how much of a problem he has considering he's like sixteen. And yeah he's a very good player, known for being a 
 quite good hitter. And he doesn't really know what he's doing with his life. He's good at the football but probably not good enough to make a career out of it and you know semi jokingly talks with Street, the QB, about just kind of like latching onto him and being some kind of member of the posse. Very happy with being a Texan, 
 and that's referenced a few times. Probably going to die of alcohol poisoning, probably not going to do much with himself after High School. Also seems to have difficulty connecting with people generally even as friends doesn't seem to have much of a personality almost, he's kind of just like stereotypical football player..."
SID000278,TyraCollette,"Tyra is meant to be kind of the it girl at the school. Blonde, attractive, apparently pretty shallow at first but like a lot of the characters there's more depth later. She's in a relationship with what's his name, Tim the alcoholic football player, but at least the first it's clear that I don't know she has a foot out the door
 so to speak. She's also interested in Smash to some extent, the running back, and she's also like pretty caring that becomes apparent when she checks in on Street after he gets injured even though they don't know each other that well, but it seems like everyone kind of knows everybody to some extent. 
 She's kind of like like an upper class citizen in the high school kind of. Most people are like a step below the football players or and then below the football players or like cheerleaders some, some other kind of cheerleader, but she's not in any of that. She kind of like jumps over that by dating one of the football 
 players I guess. She definitely cares a lot about the alcoholic guy she's dating even though she I think kinda cheats on him at one point with Smash or it looks like she's going to, but kind of ends up to deciding against it. Kind of a flirt I guess."
SID000894,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy Garrity is Streeter's girlfriend's dad. You can tell he's very rich, seems to have a lot of power in the town. A lot of control over the Panther football team and kind of a lot of influence on how the team goes and who's on it and
 how it does. I can only assume that that's because he has a lot of investment as a capital in the town and it's reputation, And so you can tell he's very committed to this football team, but as his wife said not so much to his family which is interesting. He is kind of controlling 
 and manipulative, you can see that in a lot of his ? in the show. And you can tell that he is someone who stresses the coach out very much, is kind of like the coach's nemesis in the situation. It's like a struggle for power over the football team so that's interesting to watch.  I think overall he's not really that nice, just manipulative, super rich,
 you know, that's it."
SID000894,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor is the coach of the football team. He seems to be new just based on some comments made by some guy in a diner. This is like his first year coaching the team, the Panthers, and he went through a lot of stress I'd say he's really stressed out you know a lot of people are expecting a lot of wins from this team. I guess the previous coach really whipped them up into shape and so
 there's a lot of pressure for him to get them to exhibit the same amount of greatness that they had before. So he's he's working the guys really hard, you can tell he's kind of misunderstood at times. And then in turn he misunderstands his wife, but that's a whole other situation. Yeah he's very hard-working, he's under a lot of stress, but he does have a compassionate side, you can tell he cares for his 
 football players especially certain ones and he does take care of a them, he's a very caring man. He is also a little aggressive at times, making them do a lot of things like extra workouts and running in the rain and knows all about showing who's the Boss, I guess that's what it takes to be a coach. So yeah, he's got a kid, Julie, he's got a wife
 who's the guidance counselor and yeah where they're there altogether. That's it."
SID000894,JasonStreet,"So Jason Street was the star athlete of the high school. He was the quarterback who the starting quarterback who got injured in the school's first game of the season and so he was put into the hospital and discovered that he was paralyzed and had to regain mobility in his hands and legs and lower part of his body in 
 general. So his family put him in a rehab facility to do so. He had a girlfriend or has a girlfriend. She was very loyal and stuff, always visiting him and his best friend's name was Tim, I think. Yeah so he used to have dreams of going to the NFL and being a big football player but now 
 he's kind of battling with himself as to whether these dreams can still be a reality because he has yet to regain mobility in crucial parts of his body so you can kind of see where the story is going for him in terms of whether he'll be able to make his dreams happen and get out of rehab and kind of, not go back to the same guy that he was, but be like maybe a better version of who he used to be before
 the unfortunate accident on the football field. Yeah, that's all I can say."
SID000894,JulieTaylor,"So Julie Taylor is the daughter of Coach Taylor. She's a dancer, she's on the school dance team. Matt Saracen seems very interested in her but for some reason she's not really reciprocating for whatever the reasons are, probably 'cause he's on her dad's football team. You can tell she's a little sassy but that's cool, it's part of her personality. They didn't
 really focus a lot on her in the show in terms of her like personality or character or anything. She's just kind of there. She was very helpful though, she seems to be very helpful she helped the mom with the big game day rivalry dinner barbecue at their house. She was the one that was running to the store and helping with a lot of the prep so that's very indicative that she's a good child.
 Yeah, she's blonde, I have no idea how old she is I don't think it was actually mentioned. The only interest that was shown was that she dances really. Yeah. That's it."
SID000894,LandryClarke,"So I really don't recall that much about Landry Clarke besides the fact that he is Matt's close slash best friend. Yeah he was always at  the games cheering him on. Always seems to be that supportive friend you know always giving pep talks, always whispering something in Matt's ear.
 Yeah I don't really recall a lot about him but I'm not sure if a lot was going given on his character so yep. That's it."
SID000894,LylaGarrity,"Lyla Garrity is the girlfriend of Jason Streeter. She's I'm assuming an 'IT' girl and a cheerleader for the football team. So when he gets to the hospital she's very supportive, very loyal, she goes to see him everyday she bring him food, she feeds him, she spent her birthday with him, like she was very committed to this guy. She also had this idea that they would 
 still have the life they planned to have before Jason ended up in the hospital: that they would get married and do all these great things, but unfortunately she was emotionally distraught and slept with Jason's best friend and continues to sleep with Jason's best friend so no one really knows where that's going to go, I don't know but you can tell she still cares about Jason so she just seems like everybody else, very conflicted and emotionally compromised.
 Yeah but she seems like a good person. Her mom's nice.  You can tell her mom really cares about her well-being. Her dad is like one of those people you can tell invests a lot of money in the town so he's very invested in the football team and like the state of it and so he doesn't really seem to pay that much attention to her compared to her mom. So who know, that could be a thing in her life. 
 Yeah, she has a lot of friends, is cool. She's southern I guess, this place seems to be in the south. Yeah that's it."
SID000894,MattSaracen,"So Matt saracen is I guess the new start quarterback for the football team in replacement of Streeter. He lives with his grandmother who has dementia and his father is in the military. He has a lot of weight on his shoulders, you can tell he's just very stressed. He has to be the man of the house while his dad is away and he's
 constantly reminding his grandmother to take his pills to take her pills. Yeah he he's working really hard to be the quarterback that everyone wants him to be but is afraid he's going to get replaced very soon. He's also into the coach's daughter, I guess he finds her attractive, but that's really just a conflict of interest. He dropped
 calculus recently to take on more time for football practice so I guess he's devoted to something. Yeah but he's just really stressed, he's got a lot going on in his home life, school life, and you can tell he's just trying to rise to the occasion and take what's he's given and run with it. So yeah, that's it."
SID000894,SmashWilliams,"Smash Williams is a runningback or something, I don't know the proper terminology but his job is to run. And yeah, that's his thing. You can tell he's pretty arrogant, has a very cocky demeanor, and he's portrayed as not being nice at times. Well that's interesting, yeah I think he has a 
 pretty big family, I saw multiple siblings at one point. Seems as though they're not the most well-off. And yeah he's he's an alpha male. That's that's what I say about his character. He hooked up with Tim's girlfriend, that was cool I guess. Doesn't really seem like 
 he has another commitment in his life besides football. Yeah he's also, has a very tough guy persona but who knows if that's his actual persona it's only been a couple episodes like two or something. So yeah I mean ? interesting. You can tell he's not relaly the most loved on the show 
 but they  kind of need him to because he's a great runningback or whatever. So he's kinda like tolerated in a sense. But he is the same kind of wild, bad boy impulsive ? leader. The rest of the football players are to be honest, yeah I don't really see much of a difference."
SID000894,TamiTaylor,"So Tammy Taylor is the wife of coach Taylor, daughter of Julie Taylor I think. She is also a school guidance counselor. She's I think she's a good wife I don't know seems like a good person, she seems to be very like caring for her students and people in general. You know, she does the whole housewife thing even though she's 
 not a housewife. And she's really cool I think she kind of stood up to her husband and she was like 'yeah you are disrespectful and you're not helping me and like my life is tough too and it's not just you know' so she kind of has like a somewhat I guess feminist role in the show. 
 She, she makes her opinion heard which is cool I think. Yeah, she's a she's a good woman I think. She seems to be very in tune and aware of her surroundings and how people are feeling in her surroundings and then adjusts accordingly. Or not. So yeah, that's it."
SID000894,TimRiggins,"Tim Riggins is like the stereotypical hot, like disconnected, bad boy with emotional problems. You can tell he's got a lot of issues. Don't we all though. And yeah he drinks a lot, probably sort of an alcoholic. That seems to be how he numbs his pain and his thoughts. He just drinks, drinks, drinks. 
 He basically let his ex-girlfriend go in a very brutal way and started sleeping with his ex best friend's current girlfriend which is interesting I mean who knows maybe he had a thing for her before or if it's just like developing because it's the girl he can't have, but he has yet to see Streeter in the hospital which is 
 pretty awful but as it was revealed he was feeling guilty that he wasn't there to to save Jason and to stop this injury from happening. So it's probably that and that he's sleeping with his girlfriend why he won't go see him in the hospital. I mean, I feel like he gets away with a lot of things that other people wouldn't be able to get away with. Like he threw a glass bottle at Smash                                                 and I feel like regardless of what Smash said anyone else would have gotten in way more trouble than he did. He kinda just got to walk away from it so I guess that's just like the vibe around him, he just kinda does whatever he wants and people watch and think but they don't actually do anything and when they do he's kinda just like 'go away' and they do. So yeah, he's that guy. That's it."
SID000894,TyraCollette,"So Tyra was, is Tim's ex-girlfriend she seemed to be his ride or die but all good things must end. Yeah there isn't really much about her I guess. She still kind of did what she wanted, had her own agency to do what she wanted. 
 So that was kind of cool. She's pretty independent, one of the more independent women I saw in the show. I don't think she's a cheerleader, didn't really give that vibe. But yeah she did seem to be like a very supportive person who you could tell would be there when you need them, that kind of situation. 
 Yup, that's really it she wasn't really a main character just persay there wasn't really much about her."
SID001018,BuddyGarrity,"alright so Buddy Garrity is actually the previous coach to the Dillon Panthers before... Coach Taylor kind of steps up and is taking the team to State I think before he's also the father of Layla Garrity who is Jason Streeter's girlfriend also a super goody two shoes but she doesn't 
 really care that much about what Layla is going through specially after Jason's accident his ? is kind of like pressuring Coach Taylor's pressuring him to make certain decisions and like change up the quarterback so they can get a better one he's also kind of sleazy he like illegally brought in a quarterback into the team so 
 that the Dillon Panthers would be so much better and would start winning their game and he's just a really cocky person that is really off-putting sometimes in the show and you would never think that he was the father of Layla Garrity I would say they're almost opposite
 characters rough around the edges and I guess what a Texan is like stereotypically known as like that's Buddy Garrity he's like always wearing his hat cowboy hat yeah that's it"
SID001018,CoachTaylor,"Coach Taylor is the new head coach of the Dillon Panthers he's inexperienced the coach ? and the whole town kind of believes that he'll fail at bringing the Panthers to State which is the only thing that the small little town in Texas has going for them so there's a huge pressure on Coach Taylor he
 knows where to hit players buttons to excel and be their best I would say he's pretty supportive and goes beyond what a coach is supposed to do and is trying really hard to get them to stay and really wants to accomplish whole show ? especially who he is at home with his wife 
 Tami I think they were thinking of moving to a new house but they are under a lot of financial stress but that doesn't keep him from still loving his wife and his daughter Julie Taylor and it seems like he and his wife have a healthy relationship but even though tensions of football is kind of 
 breaking them down ? breaking them and I'm pulling apart but he knows when he's done something wrong and can apologize to Tami sincerely and I think mixes his priorities sometimes like whether or not family or football should come first"
SID001018,JasonStreet,"So Jason Street is the former quarterback of the Dillon Panthers who was praised as being like the leader that's going to take them to state and coach Taylor's like player that he's coached for for many many years and that's kind of the reason why Coach Taylor is 
 on that team coaching everyone and Jason Streeter or Street is dating Layla Garrity and he suffers really bad spinal injury during the first game which puts him to the hospital and essentially paralyzes his leg  
 Lyla Garrity is kind of in denial during this whole time and he's getting frustrated that you know he can't walk for himself and have control of his life he his best friend is Tim Riggins who is having like a hard time accepting this accident of his and 
 Jason Street kind of gives up on his whole goals of going to Notre Dame and getting recruited and being QB there and all these things dating also his relationship with Layla kind of starts down finally ? when Layla cheats on him yeah we'll see if he..."
SID001018,JulieTaylor,"Julie Taylor is Coach Taylor and Tami Taylor's daughter only daughter and she is only 15 I think so she's probably like a freshman at the high school and she is a huge book worm and is characterized/stereotyped ? as being kind of 
 the smarter character out of all of them. She also likes to do dancing and it really take aparts when her dad can't make it to her things and prioritize her. She also is kind of negatively affected by her parents start to fight 
 because there's definitely tensions that coaching has created in the family Julie also has this rule that she never talks to football players and always rebusts their attempts to talk to her except Michael Saracen kind of super adament about talking to her and getting taking her out on a date 
 so she has a bit he has a bit of a crush on her after a bunch of attempts she I think is starting to warm up to him and she's really bubbly and kind of is the ? role in the family so yeah."
SID001018,LandryClarke,"Landry Clarke is Michael Saracen's closest friend but nobody really likes him not even Michael so I don't know how that works but his grandma is especially weary of him because Landry is know to kind of  suggest really stupid things to Michael like he'll constantly say like you should just quit football 
 whatever happened on the field was a conspiracy theory or stuff like that which I think Michael takes to heart and kind of lessens his confidence he doesn't really have that supportive friend Landry's also kind of like the comic relief I don't really think he's funny but yeah what else... he's really dimwitted and he doesn't really 
 seem to have a huge role in the show except for being that weird friend of Michael Saracen that nobody really wants to talk about he gets rejected by girls all the time and I feel like he's that kind of guy who would end up like living with his mom like 30 years down the line yeah...let's see 
 also like who names their kid Landry yeah he also does knows nothing about football like absolutely nothing so that doesn't really help"
SID001018,LylaGarrity,"Layla Garrity is the ex head coaches daughter also the quarterback Jason Streeter's girlfriend who decides to stick by her boyfriend even throughout like his spinal injury getting paralyzed however she's super doubt ? she doesn't want to accept the fact that
 her boyfriend is never going to reach these life goals that he promised to her so she constantly pushes him to keep his goals of becoming quarterback again and getting recruited to Notre Dame in his mind which kind of creates tension between the two she is a little bit in mourning of their relationship so I think she's 
 trying to find other outlets one of which is Jason Streeter's best friend Tim Riggins now they have some sort of relationship going on and she's cheating on Jason Street she claims that she's a good person and a goody two-shoes but most of the time just comes off as really annoying and 
 yeah I would say she's devout and doesn't really focus too much on her school work maybe she I think is also the head cheerleader who is basically going to become a housewife that's harsh but yeah that's Layla Garrity"
SID001018,MattSaracen,"so this character is a newly assigned quarterback after Jason Streeter suffers his accident and he would be best described as someone who isn't really confident in himself and is only good on the field when he feels like he has a bunch of support behind his back he sort of an outsider in 
 the group and nobody really takes him seriously and he suffers from a hard home life. His dad is in Iraq right now and his grandpa is in the beginning stages of dementia so he definitely gets in his head when he's playing additionally 
 he has a crush on the coach's daughter and in the latest episode it seems that he may or may not be replaced by this new quarterback that is coming in from Louisiana and he has this friend called Landry I think and he's kind of dimwitted and 
 Michael's kind of the smarter one and the more confident one but even so I would say that compared to Jason Streeter he...he doesn't have that same confidence to be a leader he's not really a leader on the field or off the field so yeah Michael Saracen and nobody gets his last name right for some reason"
SID001018,SmashWilliams,"Smash Williams is an essential player on the team he is one of the start runners I believe and he is super self-confident and believes that he is the main reason why Dillon Panthers might be taking to State and his ? is kind of  
 doesn't sit well with Tim Riggins and they have this huge rivalry and Smash Williams kind of does a bunch of things that gets under Tim and other players skin I feel like cause a bit of drama. His cockiness is kind of his downfall though because I think Coach Taylor never takes him seriously 
 and never would think of him as like a ? captain. he also has a mother and a sister and he treats them awfully so that leads me to believe that he's kind of ?
  and is always hitting on girls yeah and his name is Smash I didn't know that until half way through"
SID001018,TamiTaylor,"alright so Tami Taylor is the wife of Coach Taylor and she best described as kind of a housewife thats risen to like housewife star status when her husband becomes coach. All the moms at Dillon high school kind of wanna invite her to a bunch of these parties 
 to like get the latest deets on Coach Taylor's playing gamer style or what's going to happen on the field that week she has a daughter and she's just very much love her family I would say that her priorities are kind of different from her husband and that's kind of creating tension like she really  
 wants to move into a new home she really doesn't want to stress about football that much we don't have that much backstory on her except for the fact that I think she really loves her husband recently she's become the guidance counselor at the school and Coach Taylor was kind of like oh don't do that so you can definitely see that their marriage is evolving from a more relaxed  
 like loving relationship that doesn't really fight that much to one that's full of tension because of the Friday Night Football games which is funny because I think coach Taylor was warned about something like that early on in episode 1 so...yeah"
SID001018,TimRiggins,"Tim Riggins is the star defense player on the Dillon Panthers but he's kind of known as the bad boy of the group like he'll walk out on practice and really wants to put fire to the coach he's a super like a beer drinker 
 and he I think is really vulnerable at times like he stays with his brother we don't see like his parents at all in the picture and he's going through a hard time when his best friend gets a spinal injury Jason Street and his like sort of girlfriend Tyra like she saw him a bunch of times 
 she sleeps with Smash Williams who is Tim's like biggest enemy yeah Tim also starts to develop feelings for Layla Garrity when after Jason Street's accident and because she is selfish like that 
 he has a hard time accepting the fact that his best friend in a hospital and doesn't really want to come to terms with that and he really thinks himself up hon the accident thinks he could have prevented it since he has was defense he I think feels guilty about that situation so he never really visits Jason in the hospital yeah"
SID001018,TyraCollette,"Tyra is kind of the opposite of Layla Garrity in that she isn't a Goody Two Shoes she we don't really know much about her home life or her school life what we do know is that she used to date  
 Tim Riggins sort of not really and was also making passes at a bunch of other football players she is super sarcastic and antagonizes a lot of people doesn't really like a lot of people she craves attention especially from Tim Riggins and when she doesn't get that she  
 hooks up with Smash Williams who is Tim Riggins kind of biggest enemy which gets under his skin and Tim Riggins' is like I don't want to hang out with you so Tyra yeah sleeps around a lot 
 she also I think think she's much closer to people than she actually is like she and Jason Street had some sort of friendship but Tyra reprimands someone for like not even knowing Jason Street and she's like I know him like you don't but in reality like she she doesn't really know she's not that close with anyone so yeah"
SID000973,BuddyGarrity,"Buddy Garrity is the absolute worst just so scummy all around and shady and he cares way too much about football like way too much like it really is just a game and I think all the amount that all the characters in the show care about football is a little excessive but Buddy Garrity in particular  how he takes it too an extreme and overall I definitely see where Lyla gets it from like he's 
 horrible she's horrible it makes sense"
SID000973,CoachTaylor,Nothing to transcribe (subject probably fell asleep)
SID000973,JasonStreet,"so Jason street is overall such a nice guy which is why his injury makes it is so much more devastating especially because he kind of breaks like the typical jock stereotype of like being super like bro-y and nasty he's just like a really sweet guy and he cares about his family it seems like and has a lot of respect for Matt Taylor. I really liked how he approached the fact of that he won't be playing anymore 
 with Coach Taylor and just kind of accepting Matt Saracen a little bit and saying that he iand showing a little bit of faith in Saracen I really enjoyed that other than that I don't think we got to know the character very much so there's not much to say"
SID000973,JulieTaylor,"I like Julie I thought she was just overall pretty chill and a lot like her mom in that she was like sassy a little bit and she wasn't like your typical coach's daughter I don't think I definitely felt kind of bad for her that like a bunch of like football players or I think Matt Saracen in particular and his friend were like kind of like obsessed with her and that left her
 uncomfortable and annoying to deal with but other than that I think she's a pretty solid character but not much to speak about"
SID000973,LandryClarke,"oh man Landy Landry Clarke I mostly just felt bad for that character he was just very much the odd one out in terms of like the cast and the character and I think its very clear from like the very beginning of that series that he might not be as close to Matt as he once was once Matt becomes like the first string quarterback 
 I just felt bad like he's kind of weird and there's nothing wrong with that but it does definitely like kind of keep him out of like the center social circles I guess so yeah he also has some really weird like varies is into like odd games which I guess is cool but is definitely different from the rest of like the plotline"
SID000973,LylaGarrity,"Lyla Garrity is the absolute worst she's essentially just a pretty head cheerleader who has faced basically no adversity in life and what... the moment that she first does face adversity which is not even hers its her boyfriend's really the only reason the only way she knows how to react is to deny it completely and 
 essentially just ignore it and to top it all off she basically cheats on her boyfriend with her boyfriend's best friend which is just messed up on every level especially when you consider that her boyfriend is like an angel and also paralyzed so yeah that's how I feel at Lyla Garrity I don't like her very much and I don't think she deserves half of the Luxury or the sympathy that we're expected to give her so yeah... 
 she also sounds really stupid if that like I don't know adds to anything"
SID000973,MattSaracen,"Matt saracen I thought was such a great guy he's like unconventional in lot of ways and that like he draws and that he just in terms of how...the fact that he has a job and like supports his Grandmother I thought that was really great. And the way he cares for his grandmother too is really sweet I thought he handled the situation that he was put in the first episode with how to play the game suddenly was really great and honestly I don't think 
 he has that much of a personality per say he's just like some regular dude and there's not really much to say about him I did think that his whole storyline with Julie coach Taylor's daughter was fucking hilarious it's like I... especially when Coach Taylor kind of pieces together and I hope it works out for them but I don't know"
SID000973,SmashWilliams,"Smash I thought was a really irritating character, super cocky and the way he tried to be kind of like replace Street once he was injured was overall just really scummy and I don't think he was he did a very good job of redeeming himself afterwards just constantly he was either like cheating with Tami or 
 again even in that one scene he was like disrespecting his mother and he also like doesn't seem like he helps out very much around the house just like the wives and the sisters would do everything. Based on the few things that took place on his in his house but other than that like as a football player he's super cocky and disrespectful especially to Coach Taylor and overall I don't think I enjoyed his character very much"
SID000973,TamiTaylor,"oh man I love Tami I think it would have been very easy to write coach Taylor's life as like as really like passionate character but I think she does such a great job of like being perfectly sassy and witty and I think she would first of all make a great guidance counselor so I'm really happy that they chose that job for her and I really enjoy like this relationship she develops with 
 Matt in terms of just like being like a motherly figure or like a doc... or guidance in the way that coach Taylor can't. I also just loved how she handled the whole rivalry week dinner I mean lunch thing with hunt...with like managing all of that but like still setting up like the boundaries that this can't happen again with Coach...with Coach Taylor and that he needs to respect her I guess more so yeah I really liked Tami Taylor and her relationship with her husband"
SID000973,TimRiggins,Nothing to transcribe (subject probably fell asleep)
SID000973,TyraCollette,"Tyra I really actually like I thought she was funny honest and like irreverent in all the right ways and she never came off as like entitled or I mean not too entitled and she I think had like one of the best interactions with Streets in terms of like talking to him about his paralysis which I really appreciated 
 I do have to like I do wonder like why she is dating Tim Riggins just based on that fact that he's not very nice to her or it seems that way to me or he doesn't respect her but yeah overall I think Tyra is a pretty solid character"
SID001141,BuddyGarrity,"so if I'm not mistaken I think Buddy was the guy that was always kind of he was very hateful towards Coach Taylor and he just really did not have faith in the team and he kept pushing for Vodoo to join the team but in many ways like he was lacking as a coach because he didn't understand what these guys were coming from and like he didn't really care to get to know about the Dynamics of the team and he just kept pushing for 
 Vodoo to join and there was a lot of parts where I felt really annoyed by him and how he like just dealt with the matter and put pressure on to Coach Taylor for selecting quarterback he was very rude just disrespectful yeah I really didn't like him I thought he was kind of like the villain of the movie yeah"
SID001141,CoachTaylor,"so I started out by really liking Coach Taylor too I thought he was a man who was really dedicated to his work and just like to the football team but then at one point I felt like he was a little too harsh on them and even after the quarterback got the injury like he wasn't just very he wasn't really he didn't show as much grief as I would have liked to see he just kind of moved on and like 
 was okay with injuring more kids and the fact that he would like call them out during the night I felt like that was really annoying and he shouldn't have done that but I really saw his dedication through like the barbecue that he threw the party and so I in a sense like I think that he's does way more than a coach should do like he's like a second father to them in a way but the thing is I just didn't feel as sympathetic 
 towards him especially because he just treated the kids really badly at one point and while they should have been like just let off the hook for a while like yeah like they weren't and he was just really hard towards them so didn't really like him for that"
SID001141,JasonStreet,"So finally I remember the name of the football like the quarterback who got injured so yeah about Taylor Jason I really like Jason he really handled his injury really well and I just feel like a part of the plot there was nothing for me to hate him he handled his surgery really well he was really understanding to his girlfriend and the fact that he just kept pushing even though he wanted to give up 
 like there was many scences where it seemed like he just did not want to try hard anymore to regain his abilities to like hold things and walk but yeah I feel like the story would have built his character better if they started out by maybe showing how well he played and what a loss to the team was I was really unclear about what caused injury like I know that Tim had something to do with it but 
 he just kind of jumped in front of like a running person and like yeah like that's what injured him but yeah overall I thought he was a really good person really resilient and very mature compared to the rest of the characters yeah out of all day just all the football team members I think I like him a lot 
 yeah... oh and I really thought that he was too good for Lila too yeah"
SID001141,JulieTaylor,"so I was pretty indifferent about Julie she was just a rebellious teenager going through like just a lot of problems and hormones and like she just had a lot of teenage angst and the fact that she just really tried to avoid I think it was Matt like the guy who had feelings for her the new quarterback like I felt like that was just a little aloof of her like she obviously kind of saw how 
 he was just really like paying attention to her like she should have at least addressed it instead of just trying to avoid him I still remember that scene during the party when she was just kind of she had to go buy groceries and I mean that was a pretty easy task so I felt like she could have done it without like opposing her parents  like that. But again like she's really rebellious and like when
 Matt tried to stop her like she just kind of turned her back and like said bye so like I don't really know whether I like her but she was just really young and like a teenager so I guess like she didn't really contribute to the pot in any bad way and so I didn't hate her but again I don't know, she could have been she didn't really have a personality besides the fact that she was just a teenager and they had to like bother her 
 parents so"
SID001141,LandryClarke,"so Landry didn't really contribute to the plot that much I feel he was just that character that kind of showed like how dedicated the team was and so I really didn't have any like harsh feelings against him but again like I feel like I just he's just like another supporting character that the team needed to have a team so I really don't have that much to say about him besides the fact that he was just yeah he was there and 
 I didn't really have any anger or any feelings towards him"
SID001141,LylaGarrity,"so I had a lot of trouble with determining how much I like Lila in the beginning she was really devoted to the quarterback that got injured and in a lot of ways I really liked her at the beginning but then I kind of felt like she was going to get together with Tim and so I kind of anticipated it I guess but she didn't seem like a very smart person to me because she wasn't very realistic 
 and I don't know how much she helped the quarterback by being there for him she was just kind of Ditsy in a way I don't think I like her towards the end because I don't know I couldn't read her very well she was kind of one of those characters who you don't really know who what her true intentions are like it seemed like she had feelings for Tim but she just kind of supressed it and force herself to be with the quarterback and
 she's just blindly in love and I feel like there was a lot of room for her to grow and I yeah she's seemed like a really somewhat childish and like she didn't understand what was really going on so yeah... oh and to add on to that I thought she was kind of 
 promiscuous and just very yeah like I don't know I can't describe it but in some ways I think that she still like the quarterback but then again I guess she just she was really lustful so she was she sought out attention from Tim so yeah"
SID001141,MattSaracen,"I really felt bad for Matt because of his grandma's situation so he always tried to get his grandma to take the drugs but she is like kind of do not go with what he wanted and I feel like he was the character that went through the most throughout this whole movie whole series I feel like the series was mainly about him and his transformation he started out with like he was really a coward in many aspects but throughout the movie not the movie 
 the series he was a really dynamic character and you can see a lot of his growth towards the... the end and personally I didn't hate him compared to all the other characters but I feel like he could have stepped it up and just believed in himself more and like made the team proud while he just like let the team down in certain  aspects because he was just not very focused and kind of like  
 ditsy if you will and yeah like I I really liked him though I feel like he definitely deserves more attention and like film time I guess yeah"
SID001141,SmashWilliams,"so I think overall smash was a good guy he was just kind of he had a lot of he was very egotistical and when the quarterback the main quarterback got injured he seemed to like not be that respectful of him and I think he was the guy that sat in the seat of the old like quarterback but overall I didn't hate him at the end of the story I think he was better like
 the whole team got really good at functioning and he was a lot better than Voodoo in my opinion so yeah"
SID001141,TamiTaylor,"so in many ways I like Tami Taylor in that she was like the anchor to coach Taylor she was really realistic and like just your typical wife and mom who like considers everything before making decisions and in some sense I felt like she was really inflexible when it came to the party she dealth with it with such opposition and just she was very not understanding with 
 coach Taylor's plans and his dream for the team and I feel like in many ways she could have been more supportive but then again she was like that person who made coach Taylor see the other options and like how an alternative to way the way that he dealt with things so he was very harsh when he approached the team members as would be expected of a coach and she was more of like a 
 she was a psychologist and a school counselor so she was more soft when it came to dealing with problems but her methods of dealing with it was still not totally effective I feel like it needed to be a combination of what coach Taylor was doing which is like tough love and also what she was doing which is like trying to get to know the football members and the students more and so yeah I liked her but 
 but I felt a little annoyed with her during the party because she was just really not understanding and not compassionate enough and like just yeah like she didn't work well with the coach at all she just kind of like gave her input and didn't really listen to him very stubborn so yeah"
SID001141,TimRiggins,"so overall I started out by not liking Tim Riggins and I think as a character he really grew on me because towards the end even though he did get together with Lila I feel like he was always really quiet and overall he was a good friend because even though he didn't go visit the quarterback that got injured he still was like you saw in this one scene he like felt a lot of regret towards the quarterback's injury because it seemed like it was his fault 
 and he kept blaming himself and at one point I felt a little a lot of sympathy for him and even though he got together with Lila I think that he was still overall like a good person and so yeah and like as a teenager I feel like that was hard for him to go through as well like losing a best friend and yeah like he defended that seat for
 the quarterback and so like yeah I think I really I liked him at one point"
SID001141,TyraCollette,"so I really didn't like Tyra I started out being really indifferent about her but as the movie progressed, she cheated on Tim with I believe it was smash like that was when I lost a lot of respect for her and I just I just feel like Tim was better off with Lila because of her and yeah this is where I got like more sympathy for Tim because 
 she was just a really bad girlfriend like it was he was right for breaking up with her and so yeah I really didn't like her she was unfaithful just a liar yeah"
